NORTH has a perfect hand for an opening bid of 2♠.

SOUTH will be tempted to respond with his opening hand and good trump support, but he should

resist the temptation. To raise a Weak Two-bid to game you should have quick winners, not just points.}

NORTH has the same hand as in Deal 1 and again opens 2♠.

This is the type of hand SOUTH needs to bid game. Notice that even with all those winners the

pair is nowhere close to having a slam. The will probably make just ten tricks.}

Once more, NORTH has the same hand as Deals 1 and 2.

This time SOUTH has a very poor hand without any chance of making game. However, he should bid

4♠ anyway.

It is very likely that the opponents can make 4

if West gets the

opportunity to get into the bidding. Hopefully the 4♠ bid will shut him out, and 4♠ probably

won't go down more than a couple of tricks.}

NORTH has the equivalent of an opening 1NT bid and will be very tempted to bid 3NT.

That might turn out to be a disaster, particularly if NORTH is unable to reach the SOUTH hand.

NORTH should assume SOUTH can win six tricks if

best call - PASS.}

NORTH should respond 2♣, and SOUTH can do nothing but rebid the ♠ suit.
