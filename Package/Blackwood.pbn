You almost refuse to believe it! How can partner have a 1NT opener with only 1 Ace? But you trust your partner so you bid 4NT. Everybody passes and you stare in amazement at partner's 16 points.

Wouldn't it have been funny if partner had thought your 4\C bid was Stayman? And so his 4\H bid would have been showing a suit. And then your 4NT bid would have been Blackwood. And then he would have answered 5\D and you would have passed and made it!}

That makes it simple, with 2 Aces you bid a confident 6\H. If he had 1 Ace you would have bid an also confident 5\H. If he had zero Aces you would have been in a spot of trouble. And if he had 3 Aces you would have asked him how he could open a Weak-2 with that many points.}

You MIGHT say that with 13 points and partner controlling the \Cs you could jump to 2NT, "To show you my points, partner."You might say it but you won't because your first priority is to look for a Major suit fit. You bid 1\H (skipping \Ds with the two Majors). Partner now jumps to 4\H. What do you say? [BID 4NT]



Partner says you can make game even if you have a minimum 6 points. So he must have about 20. So you think you can make slam and you bid 4NT. Partner answers 5\H. What do you bid? [BID 6\H]



Partner shows 2 Aces so you bid 6\H.}

You have 20 points and it would not be terrible to open 2NT. However, strictly speaking you shouldn't open 2NT with two doubletons. So you open 1\D. Partner responds with a jump to 2NT. What do you bid? [BID 4\C]



With partner's 13-15 added onto your 20, bidding 6NT would be a reasonable bid. However, it costs nothing to check for Aces first, so you bid 4\C. (Everybody agrees this is Gerber, right?)Partner answers 4\S. What do you bid? [BID 6NT]



Easy, missing one Ace you bid 6NT.}

We are playing strong jump-shifts by Responder so partner is showing 17+ points. However, you are still stuck with your minimum opening so you just rebid 3\S. Partner bids 4NT. What is your reply? [BID 5\H]



He asks for Aces so you bid 5\H showing 2. He now bids 5NT. What do you say? [BID 6\C]



You have no King. So you reply 6\C and partner bids 6NT (safer than 6\S).}

Partner has shown one Ace and a \D void. As to what you bid, that's easy. You have no choice now but to say 6\H. This is a pretty good slam, but it is not cold. Maybe East will not lead a \C. Or maybe West will have the \DA.}

Now you know all about partner's hand. 22-24 points, balanced. Now ask for Aces. If you agree that 4\C is Gerber here then that's what you should bid. If not, then you would have to use Blackwood. Partner answers 4\D. What do you say? [BID 7NT]

Do NOT say "Partner bid a close-out bid so I'll pass." Partner's bid means he thinks you can make 4\S even though he is only counting you for 6 points. Since you have 15+ now you want to go for more. You bid 4NT and partner answers 5\D. What do you say next? [BID 6\S]



Partner has 1 Ace so you can go no higher than 6. Although you can't tell for sure that slam will make, remember you used Blackwood just to be sure you weren't missing two Aces. You are not and you have enough points so you bid it. Although you can see that 6NT would have been a great contract you had to take the safer 6\S.}

You aren't strong enough to open 2\C so you bid 1\S. Partner responds 3\S. What do you say? [BID 4\C]



Partner's limit-raise shows 11-12 points and you revalue your hand up to 22. So you are definitely in slam territory. You hope partner has 2 Aces but you cannot use Blackwood with that worthless doubleton in \Ds. Instead you make a control-showing bid of 4\C. Partner then bids 4\H. What do you bid next? [BID 4\S]



The good news is that partner's control-showing bid says he has the \HA. The bad news is that he bypassed \Ds so he does not have the \DA. Since you may have 2 quick losers in \Ds you sign off at 4\S. }

THIS IS NOT BLACKWOOD. Partner's bid is the Quantitative 4NT. He has 16 points and is inviting you to bid slam if you have a maximum opener, but to pass with a minimum. Since your 17 point hand is at the top of the 1NT range you accept the invitation and bid 6NT.}
