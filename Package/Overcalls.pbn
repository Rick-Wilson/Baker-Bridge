You have 14 points but so what. You have no 5-card suit to Overcall. You cannot make a Takeout Double with 4 of their suit. So you pass. It is important to realize that there are hands you would open but cannot overcall with.}

Partner is showing 6-10 points and three trumps. Your hand revalues to 14 at most so you pass.}

You really don't like partner's \Ss, and you do have 8 points. But 8 points is not enough to be considering game, and you would have to bid your \Hs at the 2-level. All things considered it is better to pass while you still aren't doubled.}

No matter how many times you check this hand you cannot revalue it any more than 13 points. Since partner has T at the most you reluctantly pass.}

With only 7 points you might not think you have enough to make a "free bid". But in competitive bidding situations like these, where both sides have a fit, bidding is usually better than passing. So you bid 2\S.

You might look at the Law of Total Tricks lesson for more on this subject.}

You have enough for a 1-level Overcall so you bid 1\S. Partner says 3\S. What do you say now? [BID pass]



The jump raise tells you partner has 11-14 points.

With your minimum it's going to have to be better than that to get you excited. So you pass.}

You have 10 points, but in cases like this points don't matter that much. They MIGHT be able to make 4\H. Partner MIGHT be able to make 4\S. This preemptive jump takes the decision away from them.

Looking at the hands you can see that partner is going to go down 1 at 4\S. However, that is an excellent result since they appear to be cold for 5\H.}

Nice hand. But not nice enough to double, then bid your \Hs. So you overcall 1\H. Partner says 3\H. It is your bid. [BID 4\H]



The jump raise promises 11-14 points. Your 17 plus partner's 11 or so takes you right up to game. You bid 4\H.}

Partner has at least 11 points for his 2-level overcall. He might have as many as 16. You have a perfect invitational hand including two sure stoppers in their suit. So you bid 2NT. Partner raises to 3NT and you get to play it there.}

This hand would be one point too strong to Open 1NT, but it fits the 15-18 range to Overcall 1NT. Partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? [BID 2\D]



Don't get your systems crossed. Partner did not make a cue-bid, he is using Stayman. Since you have no 4-card Major suit you answer 2\D. Partner now says 2NT and the ball is in your court. [BID 3NT]



This is just a plain old 1NT/Stayman sequence. Partner is inviting, and since you have 18 points you accept.}

Wow! Great \S support and 15 points. You cue-bid 2\D, forcing partner to bid. He says 2\S. Your turn. [BID 4\S]



Partner has not made a strong bid and it is possible that T tricks will be too high. But it is pretty likely that game can be made so you bid it. Be bold!}

You don't like to take partner out of his overcalled suit without good reason. Here you have good reason. So you bid 1\S. Partner replies 2\S. What do you say next? [BID pass]



You expect partner to have three trumps, but he has made a minimum bid. So you take the conservative route and pass.}

You have a nice easy decision here. You overcall 1\H. Then partner bids 1\S. What do you say next? [BID 2\S]



Whether you play a change of suit as forcing or not, your hand certainly qualifies as one where you should make a bid. Partner doesn't really like your \Hs but you are quite satisfied to play in \Ss. So you bid 2\S. Partner jumps to 4\S and that closes out the auction.}

You have 9 points, an invitational strength hand. You bid 3\H, inviting partner to go to game with a maximum. He declines your invitation.}

You have a sound 2-level overcall. You bid 2\C and partner replies 2\S. What is your next bid? [BID 2NT]



Partner's cue-bid obviously forces you to bid. Partner's hand might be very distributional, but rather than just sticking to \Cs you suggest with 2NT. This guarantees you have \Ss stopped. Partner likes your suggestion and bids 3NT.}

With a good 6-card suit and 10 points you make a Weak Jump Overcall to 2\D. Partner says 2NT. What do you bid now? [BID 3\H]



The 2NT bid is a standard response to a Weak 2-bid. It asks for the identification of any outside high-card if the Weak 2-bidder has more than a minimum. Here you are in the top range for your bid so you show your \HK.

That was apparently the missing link for partner, he now says 3NT.}

The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? [BID 2NT]



You might just try 4\S. Of course if partner has a minimum Weak Jump Overcall that will get you much too high. A better approach is to ask for more information from partner. The bid that asks is 2NT. Partner replies 3\D. What do you bid now? [BID 4\S]



Partner's 3\D bid tells you two things. One, he is in the top half of his 6-11 point range. Two, he has a high card (Ace or King) in \Ds. When you construct a hand for him which contains 6 pretty good \Ss and the \DA you come up with a hand which will probably make game. Bid 4\S.}
