The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 1\S]

If you thought you couldn't bid 1\S because it would have been a Reverse just think again.

A Reverse is when you bid a higher-ranking second suit at the 2-level. This is just normal bidding of suits up the line.

Partner now takes control and bids the \S game.}

{[show NS]
The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 1NT]

Don't bid 2\H. That would be a Reverse, showing at least 17 points. A 2\H bid would also show longer ! Cs than ! Hs. Don't bid 2\S. That would be showing 4-card support.

So with your minimum hand you bid 1NT which partner raises to 3NT.}

{[show NS]
The bidding has gone as shown. At your first turn you bid your \H suit, up-the-line. Decide what you would say next, then click on BID above. [BID 2NT]

You only have 7 points, but partner Reversed so you cannot pass. You need to make a bid to show your minimum, and you cannot support either of partner's suits, nor can you rebid your ! Hs.

However, you also cannot bid your \S suit. That would be fourth-suit-forcing, and would show a game forcing hand of 9 or more points.

Instead you bid 2NT. Partner has a bare 17 so he passes.}

With 18 points you have enough to make a Reverse. So you bid 2\D. Partner now says 3\S. What do you bid? [BID 3NT]

Partner's jump bid shows a 6-card suit and enough points to insist on game. You don't have \S support but you do have good \H stoppers so you bid 3NT.}

{[show NS]
The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 4\H]

With his Reverse, partner has shown at least 17 points and at least 4 ! Hs.

You could fall back on the guidelines and say that with 10 points you need to make a positive bid at this time, but it is simpler to just rely on "SHE WHO KNOWS, GOES."

Since you know of an 8-card \H fit and at least 27 points you bid 4\H.}

{[show NS]
You are the dealer. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 1\S]

It may be tempting to open 1\H, planning on Reversing in \S at your second turn to show your big hand.

Don't. A Reverse should always show an unbalanced hand with the first suit longer. So you open 1\S and partner replies 2\S.

What do you bid? [BID pass]

If you had opened 1\H partner would have replied 1NT. Then when you Reversed with 2\S he would have assumed you had a 4-card \S suit and would probably have put you back in ! Hs, your known 5-card suit.

Things would have gotten confusing, to say the least.}

[PLAY S:D7,S:D3,S:C9,S:C8,S:C5]

You would really love to pass. You have a terrible hand and you like the ! Ds better than the ! Cs.

But you are forced to bid. And since partner has 5 ! Cs and only 4 ! Ds, you should take him back to his first suit.

Mercifully he passes.}

When partner shows 17+ points with his Reverse you are sure you belong in game. Since he did not support your ! Ss you know he doesn't have four of them. You also know you have an 8-card fit in ! Ds, but surely nine tricks in Notrump will be easier than eleven in ! Ds.}

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 2\D]

With 17 points you have a perfect hand for a Reverse. So you bid 2\D. Partner then says 3\C. What do you say? [BID pass]

Partner's return to your \C suit shows he has fewer than 9 points. Although it is possible to devise a hand for him where your side could make 3NT, the risk is too great.

So you pass. It's a good thing, too.}

You have an ideal hand for a Reverse, so you bid 2\H.

Partner now bids 3\D. What do you say? [BID 5\D]

Partner has a minimum hand, but at least he came up with a preference for ! Ds.

There are no guarantees here, but you should probably try 5\D.}

With 18 points you have enough to make a Reverse. So you bid 2\D. Partner now says 3\S. What do you bid? [BID 4\S]

[PLAY S:S5]

Partner's jump bid shows a 6-card suit and enough points to insist on game. With your \H stopper you might be considering 3NT, but since you know of an 8-card \S fit you decide on 4\S.

Be very glad that you did.3NT would go down with a \H opening lead while 4\S is cold.}
