I admit it, I tried to trap you. Just because this is a lesson about Negative Doubles doesn't mean you should abandon your normal good bidding practices. You have a known 8-card \H fit so you don't need to bother telling partner about your two 4-card Minors. With 12 points and support you make a cue-bid in the opponent's suit which tells partner you have limit-raise or better.

Partner now bids 4\H which you pass.}

This is difficult. You forced partner to bid and he supported your known \Ds. But he didn't jump so you figure him for 13-15 points. Revaluing your hand you get up to 13 points so it is just possible you have a 28 point total. That's not enough for game in \Ds so you pass.

As you can see you will lose 2 \Ss and 1 \C so you made the right decision.}

You know for sure that partner has T+ points because he made a Negative Double of a 2-level overcall. So you conclude that your side has 8 \Ss and 27+ points . . .. . . and you bid 4\S.}

The general guideline for a Negative Double when both Majors are unbid is that you must have 4+ cards in at least ONE of the Majors. But for this specific sequence, 1\C - 1\D, you do not double unless you have BOTH Majors. When you have only one of them you just bid it. Like this hand. You bid 1\S. Partner rebids 1NT. What do you say? [BID pass]



Partner has a minimum hand and fewer than 4 \Ss. A good time for you to pass.}

This is one of the nicer parts of Negative Doubles. When the bidding is 1\C - 1\D, a double by you promises both Majors. It's like you are allowed to bid both suits at once, 1\S\H. So you double and partner says 1NT. It is your bid. [BID 3NT]



Partner doesn't have 4 of either Major. But he does have 13 points and \Ds stopped. You also have 13 points so you bid 3NT.}

It is the sign of a novice to support responder's 1-level response with only 3 of the suit. Very often he will have responded in a 4-card suit and you end up playing in a 7-card fit.

But that is not the case here. If partner had only 4 \Ss he would not have bid the suit, he would have made a Negative Double. Since his \S bid promises 5 it is quite correct for you to support with only 3. So you raise to 2\S and partner bids the game.}

First let's agree on what you DON'T say. You don't say "double" because that would a Negative Double showing at least one 4-card Major. You don't support partner's \Ds with just two of them. You probably don't bid 1NT with no honor in either Major. So you pass. This is called a "Trap Pass". Partner re-opens with a double. What do you say? [BID pass]



Now you see why it's called a "Trap Pass". When an overcall is followed by two passes Opener should try to find another bid. In particular he should try to double for takeout if he can. That's what North did here, but you converted it to a Penalty Double by passing.}
