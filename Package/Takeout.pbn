The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? [BID double]



You have a perfect hand for a Takeout Double. Singleton in their suit, 4-card support for the other three suits and 13 HCP. You Double. Partner responds 1\H. What do you say next? [BID pass]



Yes, you like the \Hs. But remember, you forced partner to bid and his response showed 8 or fewer points. You are not strong enough to consider a game so you pass.}

Naturally you make a Takeout Double. Partner responds 1\S. What is your next call? [BID 2\S]



With 17 HCP and the singleton you are not strong enough to insist on game. On the other hand if partner is at the top of his 0-8 point range then game is likely. A raise to 2\S invites partner to bid game with a maximum. Partner accepts the invitation.}

You need to make a strong invitation since partner needs very little for your side to have a game. So you bid 3\H. Partner has almost nothing so he passes. Good thing.}

This is certainly not a great hand, but at least the shape is good. You should strive to get into the bidding whenever possible, and with this hand the only way in is to double. Partner jumps to 2\S and it is your bid again. [BID pass]



Partner shows 9-11 points and a \S suit. However, he didn't force you to game, and you barely scraped up the double to begin with. So you pass.}

That extra 3 points makes all the difference. With that singleton \H your hand is now worth at least 16 points. Add partner's 9, T or 11 and you are at game level. Bid 4\S.}

You'd really like to have 4-card support for both Majors when you double a Minor. But it's not a requirement. So you double and hear partner respond 2\D. East then chips in with 3\D. What now? [BID 3\S]



Don't let East's bid bother you, he's just trying to push the envelope. You have a good hand and partner's bid shows 12+ points and is forcing to game. Now you have to find the right game, and the best way to start is by showing a 4-card Major suit. You bid 3\S.

That was what partner needed to hear, he bids 4\S.}

The minimum requirements for a Takeout Double are 12 points, no more than two of Opener's suit, and at least 3-cards in the other suits. You just squeak by so you double. Partner says 1NT and it is your bid again. [BID pass]



With no suit fit you can't even count a point for your doubleton so you have just 13 HCP. Partner's bid shows 8-T so you waste no time in passing. Don't worry about the \Ss, partner says he has them covered.}

The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? [BID double]



You should double. This is a special case of the Takeout Double, where the opponents have already bid two suits before it gets to you. Since they apparently have at least 20 points, you should have a solid hand with at least 4-4 in the two unbid suits. A hand just like this one.

Partner bids 2\D. What do you say next? [BID pass]



Just pass. This is obviously a fight for the partscore and you have the advantage because you have found a fit. However, you suspect partner is quite weak.}

Pretty good hand you have. Certainly good enough to make a Takeout Double that forces partner to the 3-level. Partner responds 3\H. What do you bid? [BID 4\H]



Some questions don't have a correct answer. If partner has \H Q x x x along with the \CK and \DQ he would bid just as he did and slam would be cold. But if he has four small \Hs and nothing else he would bid just as he did and you probably cannot make ten tricks. On balance it is probably best to just bid the most likely reasonable contract, which is 4\H.}

You have a perfect 2NT opening hand. Trouble is, the opponents have already opened. You get around that problem by first making a Takeout Double. Partner replies 1\S. What do you bid now? [BID 1NT]



You could not say 1NT on your first bid because that would show 15-18 points. Doubling first, then bidding the lowest level of notrump shows 19-20 points. Of course in both cases you must have their suit adequately stopped. Partner does the math and bids 3NT.}

The pattern continues. Overcall 1NT with 15-18. Double, then bid notrump with 19-20. Double then jump in notrump with 21-22. So you jump to 2NT. Partner puts it to 3NT.}

Partner obviously has a good hand. Your response showed 0-8 points and he still found enough strength to invite you to bid game. However, with your 4-point square hand you must decline the invitation.}

With 7 points you must make a minimum response. Even though \Cs is your best suit you should prefer to show a 4-card Major. So you bid 1\S. Partner raises to 2\S and it is your turn to bid. [BID 4\S]



Your first response showed 0-8 points. Knowing that, partner still invited you to go on if you were at the high end of the range. With 7 HCP and a doubleton you are right at the maximum for your bid, so you bid 4\S.}

You COULD make a game-forcing cuebid here, but a much better description of your hand is a leap to 4\H, the spot where you know you want to play. If partner has any extra strength he will know to bid again. In this case he has a bare minimum and passes.

Notice that if you had made a cuebid, partner would probably end up playing 4\H and the opening \S lead would be right through your \SK.}

The redouble has taken the force from you - you can pass if you want to. But if you pass, the most likely scenario is that West will also pass. So partner will either have to let them play 1\D redoubled (which will be a disaster for your side) or take out his own double by bidding some suit. So he will bid a suit and it will almost surely be 1\S.

You can help your side the most by bidding 1\H immediately. You don't have to worry that partner will believe you have a good hand; both he and West have 13+ points and East's redouble shows T or more. He knows there are no points remaining for you to have.

On this deal your \H bid gets passed around to East who bids 2\D, the final contract.}

The problem with making a Takeout Double of a preemptive bid is that the bidding for your side starts out a level or two higher. So you can't risk doubling with a flimsy hand. However, this hand is certainly good enough so you double. Partner responds 3\H. What do you bid? [BID 3\S]



After partner cuebids the next job is to find a suit, so you bid 3\S. Partner now bids 4\C. What do you say? [BID 5\C]



You cannot stop short of game. Partner has apparently rejected your \S suggestion. Since you are happy to play in \Cs you bid 5\C.}
