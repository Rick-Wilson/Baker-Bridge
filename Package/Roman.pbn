The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 5\S]



Since there has not been a clear agreement on the trump suit you can assume it is \Hs, the last bid suit.

So you have two Key-Cards (\SA and \HK, along with the \HQ). You therefore bid 5\S and partner bids 6\H.}

Partner's jump to 4\S indicates he is prepared to play at game even if you have as few as 6 points. So he must have 20 points or so. With your 14 that puts you in slam range. Decide what you would say next, then click on BID above. [BID 5\C]



Despite your conviction that this hand is going to slam you should NOT ask for Key-Cards holding a worthless doubleton. Instead, you make a slam try by bidding your cheapest control, 5\C. Partner says 5\H. What is your next bid? [BID 5\S]



You can only say 5\S. Partner would have control-bid \Ds if he held the Ace since controls are bid up-the-line. His failure to show it means he doesn't have it. Since you might be off the first two \D tricks you stop at 5\S.

Yes, partner should probably have opened 2NT. Sometimes partners don't make the bids you think they oughta.}

Your partnership plays Jacoby 2NT convention, so partner's 2NT shows a game-forcing raise in \Ss. Your 3NT bid indicates a 5-card suit and "extra values". Partner's 4\H is a control-bid showing the \HA. Decide what you would say next, then click on BID above. [BID 4NT]



What you need to know now about partner's hand is Key-Cards so you bid 4NT. He answers 5\S. What is your bid? [BID 6\S]



Partner's response says 2 Key-Cards and the \SQ. So you are missing either the trump King or the \DA. So you shouldn't bid 7, but you will almost surely make 6. You bid 6\S.}

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 4\D]



Partner's 3\D bid shows a very good hand with probable slam interest. It is very tempting to say 3NT now but you don't have \Hs stopped and don't know if partner does. So with good \D support you bid 4\D. Partner bids 4NT. What is your response? [BID 5\H]



You have 2 Key-Cards, the \SA and \DK. But you don't have the \DQ so you answer 5\H. Partner bids 6\D.}

Your partner's 3\H is a limit-raise, 11-12 points with \H support. Decide what you would say next, then click on BID above. [BID pass]



What you want to know is whether partner holds the \SA. If you bid 4NT and he shows two Key-Cards all will be well, you will know they are the two missing Aces. But if he shows just 1 Key-Card you will be in the soup since you can't tell if that Key-Card is the useful \SA or the practically useless \DA. So you don't use RKCB, you use control-showing and bid 4\C. Partner says 4\H. What do you bid next? [BID 4NT]



Partner would have control-bid \Ds if he had the Ace. You may not think that helps but it does since now you can bid RKCB. You bid 4NT and he answers 5\C. What is your next bid? [BID 6\H]



It was a lot of work but you have figured out that partner holds 11-12 points including one Key-Card which must be the \SA. It looks like the slam is a good idea so you say 6\H.}

You have 2 Key-Cards, the \SK and the \CA. So do you bid 5\H?

No. You have two Key-Cards AND a void. So you bid 5NT. Partner bids 6\S.}

Your partner's 2NT opener is 20-21 points and the 3\C bid is Stayman. Decide what you would say next, then click on BID above. [BID 4NT]



You know of 33 points and you know of an 8-card \H fit. The math tells you that 6\H should be a good slam but you might as well check Key-Cards, that's why the convention was invented. So you bid 4NT and partner answers 5\H. What do you say? [BID pass]



You say "Darn!" You are missing just one Key-Card, but you are also missing the trump Queen. And with partner holding only a 4-card suit that Queen might well win a trick. Knowing that at best the slam will depend on a trump finesse you pass 5\H.}

With 11 points and a good suit you should make a positive response. So you bid 2\H. Partner then says 4NT. What is your bid? [BID 5\C]



The 4NT bid agrees \Hs as trump. You have one Key-Card, the \HK, so you bid 5\C. Partner bids the \H slam.}

Partner has two Aces and the \SQ. That should be all he needs to make slam so you bid 6\S.}

You are missing 1 Key-Card. Slam has become less certain. You decide to see if partner has the trump Queen so you bid 5\D. Partner bids 5\S. What do you say next? [BID pass]



Partner denies having the \SQ. Knowing that the best you could hope for would be a finesse to make the slam you give up your quest and pass.}

Your 2\H bid is a Reverse, showing 17+ points. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 5\C]



There has been no agreement on trumps, so you assume that North has implicitly agreed to \Hs. So you respond 5\C, showing 4 Key-Cards, three Aces and the \HK. Partner next bids 5\D. What do you say? [BID 5\H]



5\D is the Queen Ask. Partner obviously is thinking about a Grand Slam and wants to know whether you hold the trump Queen (\HQ). Since you do not have the card you return to the agreed trump suit at the lowest level - which is 5\H. Partner now bids 6\H.}

Slam in \Hs is almost certain, but you should check for Key-Cards. You bid 4NT and partner says 5\C. What do you bid next? [BID 5NT]



Partner shows 1 or 4 Key-cards. Since he jumped on the second round you figure it must be 4. So you have all the Key-Cards. Time to find out about the other Kings, so you bid 5NT. Partner replies 6\D. What do you bid? [BID 7NT]



Partner has 1 King, the only one left, the \DK. You can count about 17 high-card tricks available so you bid 7NT.}

You have one Key-Card, the \HA. You also have a \S void, but since bidding 6\S would take you above the 6\H level you just respond 6\H. Partner will deduce that your void is in \Ss, particularly because you Splintered in that suit. Partner passes your 6\H bid.}

Normally you would not ask for Key-Cards with this \D holding. But since you know partner has at most a singleton, and that it is not the singleton \DA, you are safe to do so. You say 4NT, partner replies 6\D. What next? [BID 7\S]



WOW! Partner has one Key-Card and a \D void. So the Key-Card is the \SA. You don't know what the rest of partner's hand is, but he can surely take care of that small \C. You bid 7\S.}

This is the Queen Ask, wanting to know if you hold the \DQ. Since you do have it you should bid a suit in which you hold a King. So you bid 5\S. That spurred partner on - he was fishing for 7\D but when you told him you had the \DQ, \HA and \SK he was able to bid 7NT.}

Partner promises first round \S control so NOW you can bid RCKB. When you bid 4NT partner answers 6\H. This shows 1 Key-Card and a void in a suit higher than \Hs. Knowing you are missing either the \DA or \HK you pass.}

Partner is asking for Kings and you have just 1, the \HK. Remember, the \SK is not a King, it is a Key-Card which you have already counted. So you bid 6\D. Partner counts 13 tricks and bids 7NT.}

What you DO NOT say next is 4NT. If partner answered 1 Key-Card you would not know what to do. If he has a red Ace you can make slam, but if his one Key-Card were the \CA you couldn't. Instead you make a control-showing bid of 4\C, promising first round control. Partner obliges you by bidding 4\H. What is your next bid? [BID 6\S]



Partner's bidding is like the Sherlock Holmes tale <u>Silver Blaze</u>, about the dog that didn't bark. Partner's \H bid shows that he DOES have the \HA, but equally important it shows that he DOES NOT have the \DA. So you know you don't have a \H loser but do have a \D loser. You bid 6\S.}
