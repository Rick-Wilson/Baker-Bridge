You dealt this hand. Decide what you would say, then click BID above. [BID 1\D]



With 13 points you will open. You cannot bid 1\H with only 4 of them, so you say 1\D. Partner responds 1\H and it is your bid again. [BID 2\H]

[show NS]



Partner's response is forcing. He might have anywhere from 6 points to about 17. With a minimum opener and 4-card support for his Major suit you bid 2\H. Partner passes.}

[show NS]



You are not strong enough to open 1NT, but too strong to pass. You bid 1\D. Partner responds 1NT. What do you say next?

With that small doubleton in \Cs it is very tempting to rescue partner from 1NT by bidding 2\S. There are three good reasons why you don't. First, bidding 1\D followed by 2\S is a REVERSE, which shows a strong hand, perhaps 16-17 points or more. Second, and even more important, partner's 1NT bid DENIES a 4-card Major suit. And third, partner probably has something in \Cs since he has no 4-card Major and also didn't feel like supporting your \Ds.

So you pass and hope for the best.}

You dealt this hand. What do you bid? [BID 1\C]



The \H and \S suits look really good, but neither of them are 5 cards, so you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\H. What is your next bid? [BID 4\H]

[show NS]



Partner's bid shows 6-10 points and at least 4 \Hs. Since you now know there is an 8-card Major suit fit you revalue your hand, adding 2 more points for the singleton \D.

That gives you 20 points; add partner's 6-T and you have enough for game. She who knows, goes, so you bid 4\H.}

You dealt this hand. What do you bid? [BID 1\C]



You have the right strength but the wrong distribution to open 1NT. So you bid 1\C. Partner responds 1\S. What do you say next? [BID 3\S]

[show NS]



With partner's \S bid giving you a fit, your hand revalues to 18 points. If partner has only 6 or 7 points there is not enough for game, but if he has more than that then you should bid game.

When you are in-between like this you just invite. So you jump to 3\S. This tells partner to bid game if he has more than the minimum for his bid. He has 9 revalued points, so he bids 4\S.}

You dealt this hand. What do you bid? [BID 1\D]



This is the one situation when you open a 3-card \D suit; two 4-card Majors, three \Ds and two \Cs, but not enough strength to open 1NT.

Partner responds 2NT. What do you bid? [BID 3NT]

[show NS]



Partner's bid shows 13-16 points, balanced. And most importantly, it denies holding a 4-card Major suit. So you do not consider bidding either your \Hs or \Ss, but just bid 3NT.}

With a 5-card and a 4-card Minor you open the 5-card. Partner responds 1NT. What do you say now? [BID 2\C]



With only 14 points a pass might be the best bid. But with doubletons in both Majors, knowing partner does not have 4 of either, you elect to bid 2\C. Partner now surprises you and bids 3\C. It's your bid. [BID pass]

[show NS]



Partner evidently found some hidden treasure when he revalued! But you still have only 16 points at the most so you pass.}

You dealt this hand. What do you bid? [BID 1\C]



Nice hand! But not strong enough to open with anything other than 1\C. Partner jumps to 3\C! What do you bid? [BID 4NT]



You might be tempted to mention one of your Majors at this point, but resist the temptation. Trust that your partner also knows the bidding priorities and that he would have bid a 4-card Major if he had held one. The problem with you now saying 3\H for example, is that partner would probably think you had a 5-card \H suit and support you with only 3 of them. You know that \Cs is your suit so stick to it.

With partner showing 13-16 points, and your hand revaluing to 21 you are definitely thinking slam. It would not be terrible to just bid 6\C right now, but Blackwood was invented just for these situations, to make sure you are not missing 2 Aces when you bid a slam. So you bid 4NT. Partner answers with 5\D. What say you? [BID 6\C]

[show NS]



Blackwood did its job. You are missing one Ace so all thoughts of a Grand are put aside. Bid 6\C.}

You dealt this hand. What do you bid? [BID 1\D]



This would be a perfect hand to open 1NT - well, it would be if it held one more point. But with only 14 you open your 4-card Minor, 1\D. Partner responds 3\D.

What do you say now? [BID 3NT]

[show NS]



Partner suggests that \Ds is your suit, and he may be right. But you would much rather play the less demanding Notrump game if he is willing. So you bid 3NT, knowing that if partner is really distributional he will take you back to \Ds. He doesn't, so you play 3NT.}

This would be an ideal hand to open 1NT - well, it would be with one less point. But with 18 you are too strong to open 1NT so you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\S. What do you bid next? [BID 2NT]

[show NS]



DO NOT fall into the trap of supporting partner's \Ss just because you have such nice help for him. He might have a 4-card suit. Instead, just describe your hand by jumping to 2NT, showing a balanced hand with 18-19 points. Partner now bids 3NT and you play it there.}

Do not support what may be a 4-card suit with only 3 cards. Instead, jump to 2NT, showing 18-19, balanced. Partner rebids the \Ss. What do you say next? [BID 4\S]

[show NS]



Partner shows a minimum hand, but with 6 \Ss. 3NT is very tempting, and might work out fine, but with 9 \Ss it is probably better to play the suit game. So you bid 4\S and everybody passes.

Bidding 4\S was a good choice. It makes easily, yet 3NT might have gone down.}

Are you tempted to take partner back to \Cs since you have such good support? Don't be. Partner has 4 \Ss, but he might have only 3 \Cs.

Are you tempted to bid 3\S since partner raised you? Don't be. He showed a minimum hand with his single raise and you only have 9 points. Just pass.}

Some might jump to 2NT, "to show partner my point count". Some might jump to 3\D, "to force partner to game and show my \D support". The wise ones will just bid 1\H, striving to find an 8-card Major fit, the first priority of bidding.

You choose the 1\H route, and partner obligingly says 2\H. What do you bid next? [BID 4\H]

Remember "She who knows, goes"? You know of the 8-card Major fit. You know of at least 26 combined points. You know you should bid 4\H, so you do.}

When you have two 4-card suits to show you bid them "up-the-line". In this case it means you say 1\H. Partner replies 1\S. What do you bid? [BID 4\S]

[show NS]



There are enough points for game and a known 8-card Major fit. So you bid 4\S.

Perfect bidding isn't always rewarded. They can win three \D tricks and the Ace of trumps. If the opening lead is a \H or a \C you might make it, so it just depends on luck.}

You have two very good choices, neither of which is really wrong. You could bid 2NT, showing 13-16 points, balanced, or you could bid 3\D, showing 13-16 points, good trump support.

What should decide you is the bidding priorities. You'd much rather try to play a 9-trick game than an 11-trick game. And at the same time you must trust your partner not to leave you hung out in Notrump with an unsuitable hand. (Can you believe I wrote Notrump and unsuitable in the same sentence?)

Anyway, you bid 2NT and partner raises to 3NT.}

With 14 points and a 4-3-3-3 distribution this could be the perfect hand for a jump to 2NT. But not when the 4-card suit is a Major - you should not skip bidding a Major when you have the opportunity.

So you respond 1\H. Partner says 1\S. What do you bid? [BID 3NT]

[show NS]



Partner doesn't have 4 \Hs so you go back to thinking this is an ideal notrump hand. So ideal that you apply the "She who knows, goes" principle and bid 3NT. Partner smiles and passes.}

You have great \D support and perhaps 15 points. The "perhaps" is because partner may have only 3 \Ds, and if you are the long-trump hand any ruffs you take will probably not increase the number of trump tricks your side makes. But still, you have a great hand.

So you bid 3\D. Partner now says 3NT. What do you bid? [BID pass]

You described your hand very well with your first bid. Partner heard the description and chose 3NT. Since you trust your partner you pass.}

You must make a weak response, and in theory there are 3 weak responses you could make with this hand. You could bid 2\C, 1\S or 1NT. And while none of them would be actually incorrect the best choice is to show your 4-card Major.

You bid 1\S. Partner jumps to 3\S. What do you say now? [BID pass]

You started with just 6 points, and after discovering the \S fit you revalue all the way up to 7 points. Partner has shown 16-18 and that's still not enough for game. You pass.}

That is great support, but always remember when supporting a Minor that partner might have only 3 of them. So you bid 2\D. Partner jumps to 4\D. What do you bid? [BID 5\D]

[show NS]



You were cautious with your first bid, but that is over now. Partner didn't open with a 3-card suit, he really has \Ds. He bypassed 3NT in a flash, so he has no interest in playing anywhere but a \D contract. He invites you to bid game if you have something extra above the 6 points you already promised. You have a lot more than that, so you bid 5\D.}
