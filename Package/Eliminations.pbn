North's 3\S bid is a limit raise showing T-12 points and good trump support. South is to play 6\S. West leads the \HQ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

This \D holding is the first example shown in the introduction.

With one certain \H loser you cannot afford to lose a \D also. You could guess which way to finesse and be correct half of the time. But an elimination play will work ALL of the time.

Win the first trick and play \SA, \SK. Trumps split 2-1.

[PLAY N:SK,N:S4,N:H4,S:SA,S:S3,S:HA]



Next play three rounds of \Cs to eliminate that suit from both your and dummy's hand.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:CK,N:C8,N:C2,S:CA,S:CQ,S:C5]



With all the eliminations completed you are ready for the throw-in. Lead a \H from either hand. One of the defenders will win, (you don't care which), and will be end-played.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:H6,S:H3]



The defender who won the last trick cannot lead a trump because he has none. If he leads a \H or a \C you will get a ruff-sluff, ruffing in one hand while discarding a \D loser from the other. If he leads a \D you will get the free finesse you were hoping for all along.

If you finesse East for the \DQ you make the contract, but if you finesse West for that card you go down.

With an elimination play you make it no matter who holds the Queen.}

This \D holding is the second example shown in the introduction.

This should remind you a lot of Deal 1. This time you have 1 \H loser and 3 \D losers. If you can force the opponents to lead \Ds you can make a trick with the \DQ or \DJ, avoiding one of those losers.

South is to play 6\S. West leads the \HQ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

This \D holding is the third example shown in the introduction.

This is another follow-up to Deal 1. But this time you are missing both the \DQ and \DJ. In this case an Elimination play doesn't give you a guarantee, it just improves your odds.

Win the first trick and play \SA, \SK. Trumps split 2-1.

Now execute the throw-in by leading a \H from either hand.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:H6,S:H3]



The defender who gets thrown in cannot play a \H or a \C without handing you the contract by way of a ruff-and-sluff. So he must lead a \D. Suppose it is West who leads the \D. You play low in dummy and East must play either the \DQ or \DJ to keep you from getting a cheap trick with your \D9. So you take East's honor with your \DA and then finesse West for the other honor. As long as the \DQ and \DJ are in different hands the elimination play will succeed.

Against good defenders there is no way you can make all three \D tricks if you make the first play in the suit. This assumes that if one defender held both the \DQ and \DJ he would "split" the honors if you tried to lead through them. 

By forcing them to start the \Ds you make three tricks when the two outstanding honors are divided. }

Your first thought is probably that if you can guess the \CQ you will make all thirteen tricks.

So you win the \DK and play a \S to your \SK. When West discards a \D your second thought is probably that you MUST guess the \CQ just to make twelve tricks.

When you are missing the K Q of a suit, as in the \Cs on this hand, taking two finesses gives you a 75% chance of success - all things being equal.  

In this case though, West's overcall means all things are not equal, so your chances are lower than 75%.

If you had finessed for the \CK West would have won the trick and been able to make a safe exit, probably with his other \C.

You would then have been forced to rely on the \H finesse, and with West being the defender who showed some strength, you would likely have finessed through him.

About the only way the elimination/throw-in could fail is if the \Cs split 3-0. Then, if you play Ace and another the defender who wins would use his third \C as a safe exit.}

You probably noticed that you could have finessed your \CQ on the first \C play and pulled off the end-play just as effectively. But there is an advantage to making the first finesse with the \CT.

If East just happens to hold both the \CK and \CJ you will make all thirteen tricks if your first finesse is with the \CT!}

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:H5,S:HQ]

You have one trick already in the bag, four more to come in \Cs, and three other Aces. So all you have to do it get one of those finesse positions to come through. By now, though, you must have figured that nothing is going to work! Even your best shot, East holding at least one of \S K Q will not happen. The answer (again) is to eliminate, then throw in.

This time there is only one suit you can eliminate, \Cs. So play all four \Cs, ending in dummy. They split 3-2.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:H6,S:HA]

With three possible losers in \Ds you might first think that you will have to finesse one of the defenders for the trump Queen. But anytime you see an unsupported Jack opposite an unsupported Queen you should start thinking about a throw-in play. And what better card to use for the throw-in than the Queen of trumps.

So pull two rounds of trumps with the \SA and \SK, hoping the \SQ falls. She doesn't fall, but both defenders do follow suit. So the \SQ is the only trump outstanding.

South considered Blackwood, then realized if North showed either 2 or 3 Aces he was going to bid slam. But if North showed just one Ace he would have to maneuver to play 5NT which might be worse than 6\C. So he just bid the slam. South plays 6\C. West leads the \SJ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

You wish, you hope, you may even pray, but when you play the \SQ East covers with the \SK. So you know you have a \S loser. And unless East holds the \DQ you might have a \D loser also.

Perhaps an elimination play will improve your chances. Don't lead a trump yet though, you're going to need several entries to dummy to eliminate the \Hs.

Many elimination endings give you a sure thing. Others just improve your chances.

North first transfers you to \Ss, then closes the auction with 4\S. 

South is to play 4\S. West leads the \C2. East takes the \CA and returns the \C9 to West's \CK. West plays another \C to your \CQ. 

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:C8,N:C7,N:C6,S:CQ,S:CJ,S:C4]



With two tricks lost already you have a sure \D loser (unless the defenders goof) and a \H loser that might be taken care of if East holds the \HK. But what if West holds the \HK? Maybe an elimination play.

First pull trumps - they split 2-1.

[PLAY N:SA,N:S3,S:SK,S:S2]



Next eliminate \Ds by playing \DA then another \D. This does the elimination and throw-in at the same time.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:DA,N:D2,S:DQ,S:D7]



If the defender who won the \DK plays a \D or a \C you will ruff in your hand and discard dummy's \H loser. So that defender is going to have to lead a \H.

If it is West who won the \DK you are home free. His \H play will give you two \H tricks.

If it is East who won the \DK you still have a chance. He will lead a \H and you will finesse the \HQ.

In other words, played this way you make the contract whenever West holds the \DK OR East holds the \HK.

With the cards as shown the elimination play works.

But if the \DK is with East and the \HK with West it wouldn't.

Of course it is POSSIBLE that if you played a low \D from dummy some Easts would duck and let you win a trick with your \DQ. 

This trickery would fail if West held the \DK, or if East held it and went up right away.}

South plays 6\C. West leads the \S8.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



You have one \S loser and one \D loser. A successful finesse will take care of either one of them. Chance of the \S finesse working? Zero. Chance of the \D finesse working? Maybe 50%. Chance of an elimination play? Priceless.

Win the \SA and pull trumps with the \CA and \CQ. They split 2-1.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:SA,N:C8,N:C7,S:S3,S:CA,S:CQ]



Play the \DA, just in case there is a singleton \DQ somewhere. There isn't. Then eliminate \Hs by playing \HA and ruff a \H.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:H6,N:DA,N:CT,S:HA,S:H7,S:D3]



Now play a low \S from both hands. West doesn't follow suit as East wins with a small card.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:S2,S:S4]



East is end-played. He has no \Cs. If he plays a \D it will be into dummy's \D K J. If he plays a \H you will discard a \D from your hand and ruff in dummy. If he plays the \SK you will ruff, and dummy's \SQ will be promoted. If he plays a small \S you will let it ride to dummy's \SQ.

A fairly complex elimination play to finish off the set. 

I hope you enjoyed them.}
