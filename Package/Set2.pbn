SOUTH has 17 points counting 1 extra for the fifth ♠. This is a middle-range hand with five ♠s.

So he opens 1♠.

NORTH only has 7 points, 6 in high cards and one more for the doubleton

♦

.

But she does have three ♠s, so she can respond 2♠.

Since SOUTH is middle-range, he makes one more try by bidding 3♠.

If NORTH had 9 or 10 points she would now bid 4♠ - but with 7 she passes.}

With 8 points, NORTH is not strong enough to open the bidding.

SOUTH has 13 points, barely meeting the minimum for a 1-opening. Note that the fifth and

sixth ♠ each added 1 point to his count. He opens 1♠.

Although NORTH passed originally, she must respond to SOUTH's opening bid. Since she has

three ♠s she raises to 2♠.

In light of NORTH's weak response SOUTH passes.}

SOUTH has a terrible hand, and naturally passes.

NORTH, however, has a nice 18 points and opens 1♠.

SOUTH still has a terrible hand, and passes again. You need at least 6 points to respond to

NORTH has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1♠.

SOUTH has good ♠ support and 10 points, counting 1 for the doubleton ♣.

It is easily worth a raise to 2♠

NORTH cannot bid game yet, after all, SOUTH could have as few as 6 points. But she can

continue with a 3♠ bid in hopes that SOUTH actually has 9 or 10 points.

SOUTH comes through with 4♠.}

he jumps to 3♠, a Limit Raise.

SOUTH has the type of 5-card Major hand that many players would open 1NT.

He has 17 points with most of them OUTSIDE the Major suit. But, many others

would disagree so for this Deal SOUTH will open 1♠.

NORTH has 11 points and excellent (is that strong enough?) ♠ support.

So she naturally makes a Limit Raise of 3♠.

SOUTH adds the points and ignores the fact that his ♠ suit is Jack high.

He bids 4♠.}

SOUTH has a powerful hand (21 points) with a good 6-card suit. He opens 1♠.

NORTH has an 11-point Limit Raise with four trumps. She jumps to 3♠.

SOUTH now knows that the partnership holds at least 32 points, perhaps 33. Since he can see that

the opponents have no way to win the first two tricks he decides to bid the slam, 6♠}

NORTH has 14 points and opens 1♠, her 5-card Major.

SOUTH could bid 3♠, a Limit Raise with his 11 points. But it is often a good idea,

when you have five of the Major suit that partner opened with, to just go ahead and bid

the game. So South should bid 4♠ here.

See the NOTE in Deal 13. When you use weaker 5-card support hands for your jump to game, you

need to find another way to describe your opening-hand-strength type hands.}
