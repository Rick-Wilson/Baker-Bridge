The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 2\D]

With T HCP and T red cards you have a good enough hand for an immediate DONT bid. So you bid 2\D, promising that suit and a Major.

Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid now? [BID pass]



Don't get carried away, partner isn't really bidding a \H suit as much as he is letting you know he doesn't like \Ds. You were only competing for a partscore and here you are in a partscore. You pass.}

You have a terrible hand but you still cannot pass partner's double. He is requesting you to bid 2\C as a relay bid so he can name his suit.

You dutifully respond 2\C and he says 2\H. What do you bid now? [BID pass]



You didn't want to bid the first time, this time you definitely pass.}

OK, you only have 4 HCP. But you have T cards in the Majors. And, you are in the balancing seat. If East is willing to let it die at 1NT your partner must have some strength. So you should use DONT. Youbid 2\H, showing both Major suits.

Partner responds 2\S. What do you bid now? [BID pass]



Partner prefers \Ss to \Hs. Since you were bare minimum you pass.}

Your hand is too balanced to intervene over East's 1NT so you pass.

Then partner overcalls 2\D. What do you bid now? [BID pass]



Partner has two suits, \Ds and one of the Majors. If his other suit is \Hs then a 2\H bid by you would work great. But if his other suit is \Ss anything you say would not be good.

Since you can tolerate \Ds your safest call is pass.}

With T HCP and a solid 6-card suit this is an ideal DONT bid. You double and partner follows procedure by saying 2\C.

What do you bid now? [BID 2\H]



Now you follow procedure by showing your 6-card suit. You bid 2\H and everybody passes.}

Partner's double asks you to bid 2\C as a relay bid so he can name his suit.

But you don't want him to bid his 6-card suit, your hand is useless unless \Ss are trumps. So ignore the relay request and bid 2\S. Everybody passes.}

In the balancing seat it is distribution that counts, not point count. With a 6-card Major suit and a singleton you should not let them play 1NT. Youdouble.

Partner makes the relay bid of 2\C. What do you bid now? [BID 2\H]



You bid your suit, 2\H, and everybody passes. Notice that partner had a decent hand, but could not bid over 1NT in the immediate seat.}

You don't have a 6-card suit, nor do you have a 5-4 pair of suits. So even with a singleton you don't want to use DONT here. So you pass.

Partner makes a DONT double in the balancing seat. What do you bid now? [BID 2\C]



Right now you probably have a premonition about what is going to happen next. But there really is nothing you can say other than 2\C.

Your premonition came true. Partner passes and you are left playing 2\C with a singleton. Nobody promised that DONT would always get you to a good contract.}

You only have 8 HCP but with such a good 6-card suit you should interfere with a DONT bid. You double and partner surprises you by saying 2\H.

What do you bid now? [BID pass]



There is a reason partner didn't say 2\C (which you were going to pass). And the reason is that he figures you will be better off in his \Hs. Since you trust your partner you pass.}

Since partner has entered the bidding in the immediate seat he should have a pretty good hand, with 9+ cards in \Hs and \Ss.

Usually you are happy to settle for partscore after a DONT sequence, but with such an excellent fit for \Hs your hand is worth a raise.

So you bid 3\H and partner says 4\H.}

You have only 7 HCP but expect partner to have a reasonable hand since East could not keep the bidding open. With your black 2-suiter you bid the lowest one, 2\C.

Partner says 2\D. What do you bid now? [BID 2\S]



Partner's 2\D bid, the next suit up the line, asks you to name your other suit (or pass if your other suit is \Ds).

You bid 2\S and everybody passes.}

You would have opened 1NT but East beat you to it. You cannot double for penalties when you use DONT, so you pass.

Partner bids 2\S in the balancing seat. What do you bid now? [BID 4\S]



The 2\S bid shows a weak hand, with more strength partner would have first doubled, then bid 2\S.

Still, you know he has a 6-card suit and you also know that every finesse is going to work. You either bid 3\S or 4\S. Be bold.}

Partner has two suits, \Cs and something else.

With \Cs your worst suit, you prefer to play in something else. So you bid the next suit up-the-line, which is 2\D.

Partner corrects to 2\S, his "something else" and you pass.}

Partner says 2\H. What do you bid now? [BID pass]



Partner would have bid 2\D, the next suit up the line, to ask you to name your other suit. His 2\H bid says he wants to play right there.

With 16 points and a balanced hand you were planning on opening 1NT yourself.

But one of the consequences of playing DONT is that you have no bid to describe this hand. You cannot double because then partner would just bid 2\C as a relay and you wouldn't know where to go.

So you pass.}

Would you really bid over 1NT with only 5 HCP? In the balancing seat you should. Partner is marked with a pretty good hand, and you have a 6-card Major suit.

You do bid just 2\S though, rather than a double followed by 2\S, which would show a stronger hand. Everybody passes.}

You would have opened 1\D but after East opens 1NT you must pass.

Partner bids 2\H in the balancing seat. What do you bid now? [BID 2\S]



The 2\H bid shows \Hs and \Ss.

You have absolutely no preference between the two suits. But you do have a preference as to where the opening lead will be coming from - you'd like West to have to lead through East's strength. Besides you feel like playing the last hand so you say 2\S and everybody passes.}
