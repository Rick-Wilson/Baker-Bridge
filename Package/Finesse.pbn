Winners:   \S = 0    \H = 2  \D = 4    \C = 1 Total = 7

Needing two more winners you will have to make both the \SK and \SQ. This will only be possible if West holds the \SA. Win the first trick (if you don't West might switch to \Cs) and play a small \S toward dummy's \SQ. It holds the trick.

The moment of truth. You lead a small \S from dummy. East plays low and you play the \SK.

Unfortunately West takes your \SK with the \SA. He then plays another \H and you at least make 8 tricks but have no hope for a ninth one so you go down 1.

Losers:   \S = 2    \H = 1  \D = 0    \C = 1 Total = 4

West found the best opening lead for his side, exposing your \S losers before you could establish the \C suit for a discard. If you start to pull trumps right away the defense will grab the \HA, then take their two \S tricks and you will still have the \CA that you cannot avoid.

Other than the \DA the only useful card in dummy is the \DQ so you must try to make a winner out of that for a  discard. So win the \SA, lead your singleton \D and finesse the \DQ. Your luck has returned, the \DQ wins and you discard one of your \S losers on the \DA.

You need one more winner from the \H or \C suit. The straight finesse of the \HK offers a 50% chance of success. The double finesse of the \C K Q offers a 75% chance of success. It's a no-brainer. Run 4 \Ss and 5 \Ds ending in your hand. Be very careful not to discard a \C from your hand.

West has made another great lead. Any other suit would have given you a free finesse. You should duck the first \D. It is very possible that West has led from \D K Q T and will be afraid to continue for fear you have the \DJ in your hand. You'd be very happy to see him switch to any other suit.

You are in dummy for the first, last, and only time. You need to try a finesse right now, but which one?

If you finesse the \HK successfully you will surely still have a \H loser. But if you finesse the \CK successfully you will eliminate your \C loser.

Losers:   \S = 0    \H = 1  \D = 2    \C = 0 Total = 3

Your only hope for ridding yourself of two of those losers is dummy's \C suit. One possibility would be to finesse West for the \CK, and if that works, discard your \H loser on the \CA. You could then establish another \C winner for one of the \D losers. The problem with that plan is that if the finesse fails the defense will immediately take the setting \H trick.

A better plan is a ruffing finesse. Win the first trick with your \HA and pull trumps with your \S K Q.

Next play your \C7 to dummy's \CA. Then lead the \CQ from dummy. If East plays the \CK you will ruff, enter dummy, and discard two red losers on the \C J T. If East plays low instead, you discard your \H loser. West may be able to win the trick but you can ruff a \H return, and dummy will have two good \Cs on which you can discard 2 \D losers.

Why not try to drop the \HQ and keep the finesse for the \CQ in reserve? Because you and dummy had 8 \Cs between you and only 6 \Hs. So the \CQ was far more likely to be doubleton than the \HQ.}

You need to get one more winner and it will have to be a \S winner. You could lead toward the \SQ, winning a trick if West holds BOTH the \SA and \SK. Or you could finesse the \ST, gaining a trick if West holds the \SJ. Obviously the second choice is more likely.

[PLAY N:HT,N:H5,S:HK,S:H4]



Winners:   \S = 3    \H = 1  \D = 3    \C = 1 Total = 8

You need one more winner and \Cs is your best suit. If the \CK is in West's hand you can finesse it for 12 tricks. But if the \CK is in East's hand you will lose that trick and at least 4 \Hs.

Before you put all your eggs in the \C finesse basket there is one thing you should do first.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



You should test the \D suit by playing \DQ, \DK, \DA. Both defenders follow three times and your \D6 has become a winner, which you cash.

Now you have a problem. You have won 5 tricks so far and you have 4 more winners ready to take. So you can take your 9 tricks and run, or you can finesse the \C trying for 3 overtricks.

It's your decision, but click NEXT to see how your decision would have turned out.</br></br> [NEXT]

[show NESW]

At Rubber Bridge or Team play it would probably be foolish to risk your contract for the sake of three overtricks.

But at Match Point Pairs the reward would be much greater, a probable very high board. Of course with this layout it might have gotten you a bottom board.}

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 2  \D = 1    \C = 3 Total = 7

You need two more winners and \Ds is your longest combined suit. But you can only establish one extra winner in \Ds, and before you could even do that the defenders would have taken a bunch of \H tricks.

So you must turn to the \Ss for the extra two winners.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:H2,S:HK]



You win the first \H and lead . . . which \S? If you play the \SQ you will go down, even if West has the \SK. He would cover and you would be held to just 2 \S tricks.

The only way to get 3 tricks from this holding is to play East for the \SK. So play a \S to dummy's \SA and then a small \S back toward your \S Q J. Here East puts the \SK on and you are home-free.

You were a little lucky that East's \SK fell on the second round. 

If it had not dropped you would just have played a third round of \Ss, hoping for a 3-3 split in the suit.

West leads the \CA, then \CK, \C2. East follows once, then discards a \S and a \H.

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 3  \D = 2    \C = 2 Total = 8

There are two possibilities for getting an extra winner. If the \Ds are splitting 3-3 you could play \DA, \DK and another \D and establish the thirteenth \D as a winner. Or you could play East for the \SK and lead toward your \SQ.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



The chance of East holding the \SK is a little greater than 50%. (it is higher than the usual 50% because we know he started with only one \C, giving him more spaces for other cards).

The chance of \Ds splitting 3-3 is about 40%.

So you should enter dummy with a \H and play a small \S toward your \SQ.

Did it work? Click NEXT to see. [NEXT]

[show NESW]

You might have thought of another possibility; duck a \D, then play \DA and \DK to see if the \Ds split before you try leading toward the \SQ.

The problem is that you might run into this very distribution. You would establish a \D for East and when you played a \S from dummy East would jump up with the \SK and cash his winning \D for down 1.}

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 2  \D = 1    \C = 4 Total = 8

You only need one more winner. If East has the \SK or the \HQ a simple finesse will give you the trick.

There are two problems though. The first one is that if West gets in he may take too many \D tricks. But the bigger problem is that East cannot possibly have either of those two high cards. You and dummy together hold 28 HCP and West must surely hold the other 12 since he opened the bidding. Neither simple finesse will work so you must try what is called a Backward Finesse.

Hold up the \DA until the third round to confirm that East has only 2. He does. Then play four rounds of \Cs ending in your hand.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

Now play the \HJ. If West doesn't cover, you will let it ride for your ninth trick. But West does cover so you must take dummy's \HA. Next play a small \H from dummy and finesse the \H9, hoping East has the \HT. This is the Backward Finesse.

The Backward Finesse if a pretty rare play. It is against the odds so you only try it when you are absolutely certain that a normal finesse is doomed to fail.

Like this time.

By the way. Those of you with great short-term memories might think they have seen this hand before. Well, you ALMOST have. Deal 8 has an almost identical layout but a much simpler theme. Check it out.}

[PLAY N:S2,S:S6]



Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 2  \D = 2    \C = 3 Total = 8

Before worrying about where that one winner is going to come from you need to decide what to do with the opening lead. A good guideline is to hold up unless you fear a switch. Here, with all other suits well protected you would welcome a switch, so you let East win the \SQ. East then plays the \S8. Do you hold up again?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:S4,S:S7]



It probably doesn't matter, but since you cannot possibly win more than T tricks you might just as well hold up again. West wins the \SJ then plays the \S3. East discards a \H on the third \S.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:ST,S:SA]



OK, now it is time to figure out where that extra trick is coming from. Not much figuring is needed, it must come from the \D suit. Since you are missing 5 cards including the Queen, the odds favor a finesse over playing for the drop. And, since you have the option of finessing either defender are you going to finesse into the one who can set you or into the safe one?

Silly question. Of course you play the \DK from your hand, then a small \D finessing dummy's \DT, which wins the trick - and the game - and the overtrick.

Actually the odds slightly favored East holding the \DQ because East started with only 2 \Ss compared to West's 5 \Ss. Therefore East had 11 spaces which could hold the \DQ whereas West only had 8 spaces.

But in a situation like this you don't play odds. By finessing West you guaranteed making the contract even if the finesse lost because East had no more \Ss. Even a losing \D finesse would have established the one trick you needed.}

Losers:   \S = 0    \H = 1  \D = 0    \C = 1 Total = 2

This looks like a very simple plan. Since the hands have mirrored distribution there will be no discards anywhere. That means the \CK MUST be in West's hand or you will go down. But is that all there is to it?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



If West has \C K x or \C K x x then yes, that's all there is to it. But if he has \C K x x x then you won't have enough entries to your hand unless you take the first \C finesse BEFORE you start on trumps.

So win the \HA and immediately play a \C to dummy's \CJ, which holds the trick. Then pull trumps, (it takes 4 rounds), ending in your hand.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:SA,N:SQ,N:SJ,N:S9,N:CJ,S:SK,S:S7,S:S5,S:S3,S:HA,S:C3]



Next play your \CT, putting on the \C5 from dummy when West plays low again. This lets you stay in your hand to play another \C to the \CQ, picking up all four \C tricks and the slam.

This Deal took a lot of care and attention. As you can see you had to take one \C finesse before you drew trumps because you were in your hand right then and you could only get back one more time.

But also you had to play to one of dummy's honors first so you could retain that \C5 for letting you stay in your hand to make the third finesse. Bridge is great.}
