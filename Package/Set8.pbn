2NT shows a balanced hand with 8+ points, and when SOUTH then supports ♠s

NORTH makes a slam try.

NORTH bids RKC Blackwood 4NT. SOUTH shows two Keycards (two Aces) and NORTH bids 6♠.}

NORTH has a decent Limit Raise, and SOUTH tries RKC Blackwood.

NORTH replies to the 4NT bid with 5

, zero or three Keycards.

So which is it, zero or three?

Pretty simple - since SOUTH holds three Keycards himself NORTH can hardly have three also since there

are only five total. She must have zero and SOUTH signs off at 5

NORTH jumps to 4♠, confident that SOUTH could make 10 tricks

even if he just has 6 points.

SOUTH knows he can make more and bids RKCB 4NT.

NORTH's 5

So which is it? Zero or three?

NORTH bid much too strongly to have no Aces. SOUTH

bids a confident 6♠, knowing NORTH has either three Aces or two Aces plus the ♠K.}

NORTH has interest in slam after she hears SOUTH's Limit Raise.

BUT, she should not use Blackwood holding two quick losers in the

suit.

Instead she makes a Control showing bid of 4♣. (Not Gerber since it didn't follow a NT bid.)

SOUTH cooperates by making a Control bid of 4

SOUTH decides it is unlikely that NORTH is Aceless, so all he wants to know is the number of Aces NORTH does have.

He invokes RKC Blackwood.

Since no trump suit has been agreed, NORTH bids as if

s, the

last-bid suit prior to 4NT is agreed. NORTH has two Key-cards plus the trump Queen, so she bids 5♠.

SOUTH bids 6

Again, SOUTH has no problem as long as NORTH holds at least one Key-card.

NORTH needs to know how many Aces SOUTH holds.

One way to find out would be to bid 3♠, (which is forcing), then launch Blackwood.

Another way is to bid 4♣ (Gerber) right now.

The first way is probably better but we needed a Gerber example.}

and a

the ♠Q, and also has the ♣K.

NORTH knows there are enough points for slam, but she is worried about the trump suit.

SOUTH's support doesn't guarantee more than three ♠s, and if they are not headed

by the Queen she could lose a trump trick.

Her RKCB bid relieves her mind when NORTH claims two Key Cards PLUS the ♠Q.

She bids 6♠ (and hopes for a 3-2 trump split!).}

When SOUTH makes a slam try with a jump to 3♠, the best approach for NORTH is to agree on

the trump suit immediately but indicate a minimum hand by bidding 4♠.

SOUTH's next move is logical; RKCB 4NT.

NORTH shows zero or three Key Cards, and since it could not possibly be zero, SOUTH knows they are

the ♠K and both red Aces. Even possessing all the Key Cards SOUTH knows there aren't

enough points for a Grand slam.}

SOUTH's reply to RKCB is 5

What is this doing here in the RKCB Practice Pages?

To emphasize that there are many 4NT bids which are NOT asking for Aces.

In this case, SOUTH showed a balanced hand with 18 or 19 points, and NORTH invited him

to bid 6NT if he felt his hand was a "maximum". He didn't, so he passed.}

in trumps. So she stops at 5♠.}

The chances of a slam on this hand are very small, and if NORTH decides to use RKCB it will

just confuse matters when SOUTH shows two Key Cards.

NORTH has a better way to find out about the hand. She bids 2NT asking SOUTH to further describe

his hand. SOUTH should then bid 3NT, showing a solid suit headed by AKQ.

SOUTH cannot have as much as an extra Jack, so NORTH just passes 3NT.}
