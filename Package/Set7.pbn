SOUTH's 3♠ supporting bid is enough to convince NORTH to make a slam try.

NORTH bids Blackwood 4NT. If SOUTH shows one Ace NORTH plans to bid 6♠, but

when SOUTH bids 5♣ NORTH settles for 5♠}

NORTH makes a positive 3

response to SOUTH's 2♣ opener.

This promises at least 8 points and a 5-card suit with two or more honors.

SOUTH only needs to know one thing - how many Aces in the NORTH hand.

A Blackwood 4NT tells her the answer is one, so she bids 6

When NORTH opens 1NT, point-count alone tells SOUTH that 6NT can surely be made.

NORTH is bound to hold at least two Aces. But SOUTH doesn't want to miss a Grand slam.

SOUTH bids 4♣, (Gerber), and NORTH admits to just two Aces.

So SOUTH settles for the small slam.}

NORTH has a powerhouse and knows she will reach a slam somewhere. When SOUTH

supports the ♠s, it seems she has found her spot.

Blackwood tells her that SOUTH has two Aces.

She can see there are 12 tricks available and decides to take a chance that

SOUTH will have a thirteenth trick somewhere among his opening hand points.

She bids 7NT.}

SOUTH not only has 20 points, he also has a lot of winners.

So when NORTH jumps to 2NT, showing 13-15 points, SOUTH uses Gerber.

NORTH shows two Aces so SOUTH decides 6NT will be just right.}

When NORTH gives immediate ♠ support, SOUTH's thoughts naturally

turn to slam. This is a good hand to use Blackwood on, so SOUTH bids 4NT.

NORTH's 5

answer shows one Ace, which SOUTH cleverly deduces

must be the ♣A.

SOUTH bids 6♠ since NORTH has not bid strongly enough to think about 7.}

NORTH has 13 points and can contribute six tricks so she figures that twelve tricks will be a slam (dunk).

However, just to make sure the opponents don't take the first two tricks she checks with Gerber.

Uh Oh, missing two Aces she signs off at 4NT. She could also happily play 5♣, but it

would be tricky to get there. Very tricky.}

Yes, this has nothing to do with Gerber or Blackwood, but everything to do with smart bidding.

SOUTH has a 16 points and NORTH has 15, 16 or 17. SOUTH wants to be in 6NT if NORTH has 17,

but merely a Notrump game if she has 15 or 16.

The way to find out is to bid 4NT - not Blackwood but merely an invitation to bid 6NT.

In this case, NORTH has but 15 points and declines the invitation. If her
