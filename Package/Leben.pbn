The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 2\S]

This is a sign-off hand. If East hadn't bid you would either have bid 2\S, which partner would have passed, or 2\H, transferring partner to 2\S which YOU would have passed.

With lebensohl you can do the same thing, so you bid 2\S and partner passes.}

With 12 points opposite partner's 15-17, this is a forcing-to-game hand, so you bid 3\H. Don't think of it as a jump, just a 3-level bid showing at least 10 points and a 5+ card suit.  

Partner has 3-card support and is happy to bid game in that suit.}

Partner's bid at the 2-level is a sign-off, the equivalent of the old "drop-dead" response.

With 11 points opposite partner's 15-17, this is a forcing-to-game hand, and it is possible that a jump to 3NT (which says you have no \C stopper) would work. However, with two 4-card Major suits you should use the lebensohl equivalent of Stayman, which is a cue-bid of 3\C.

Partner bids 3\H. What do you say? [BID 4\H]



With a known 8-card Major fit and a known 26-28 points you bid 4\H.}

With your hand you'd like to sign off in 3\D. But you cannot actually bid 3\D because that would show a forcing-to-game hand. So you bid a lebensohl 2NT.

Partner makes the relay bid of 3\C. What do you say? [BID 3\D]

How about . . . . pass? Partner just signed off with this sequence. He couldn't bid 3\H directly, that would have been a game-force.}

Playing lebensohl you do the same thing, jump to 3NT. Since you went directly to 3NT you are telling partner you have that type of hand, but DO NOT have a \H stopper (DIRECT DENIES).

Partner does have them stopped so he passes.}

With your 12 point balanced hand you know you are going to play in game. Since you have no interest in looking for a 4-4 Major suit fit you also know that game is going to be 3NT. But you can't actually BID 3NT, because partner would almost surely take you out to a minor suit. Remember, a DIRECT 3NT bid DENIES a stopper in their suit. Since you have East's \S suit stopped, you first bid a lebensohl 2NT.

Partner says 3\C. What do you bid? [BID 3NT]



You now complete the picture of your hand by bidding 3NT. (SLOW SHOWS). Partner passes.}

With 9 points you don't want to sign-off with 2\H. But you aren't strong enough to force to game with a 3\H bid either. So you start an invitational sequence by bidding 2NT.

Partner says 3\C. What do you bid? [BID 3\H]



Now you bid 3\H. Partner will realize you have better than a sign-off, but were not good enough to bid 3\H immediately. He has a maximum, and he knows you have a 5-card suit, so he bids 4\H.}

It is possible your side can make 3NT on this deal. You have 9 points, invitational strength, and your \D stopper is excellent.
