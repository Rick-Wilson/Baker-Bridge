NORTH's 2NT response is Jacoby - a game forcing ♠ raise.

SOUTH's 3NT bid shows extra strength, a 5-card trump suit and no singleton/void. This is

definitely NOT a suggestion to play Notrump - the trump suit is already agreed as ♠s.

NORTH cannot make any positive move, so she bids 4♠ which SOUTH passes.}

Following SOUTH's Jacoby 2NT, NORTH bids 3♠. This is stronger than 4♠ and

shows a 6-card suit.

SOUTH has already bid the full strength of his hand so he signs off with 4♠ which NORTH passes.}

SOUTH is concerned about the

NORTH indicates an above normal opening with five ♠s by her 3NT rebid.

SOUTH also has some extra strength so he makes a Control showing bid of 4

Despite both partners showing extra strength North merely signs of at 4♠. Why? Because SOUTH's

Control bid of 4

denied first-round control in both ♣s and

SOUTH has a minimum opening hand with no extra features to brag about.

NORTH would have cooperated if SOUTH had made a slam try, but she doesn't have enough

opening bid.

But he should not bid 2NT since that bid promises 4+ cards in support. South must still insure

they reach game, so he bids a forcing 2♣.

NORTH should not be tempted to use Jacoby 2NT with this hand. There are only 12 points, and

the Limit Raise is a perfect way to show a 12 point support hand.

SOUTH has more than enough strength to bid game after NORTH's limit raise. If NORTH had

mistakenly used a Jacoby 2NT response, SOUTH would probably have tried to reach slam,

and perhaps gotten too high.}
