s, knows there are at least 33 points, but needs to make

sure the opponents don't have two Aces so she uses Blackwood.

{SOUTH has a minimum 2♣ opening.

NORTH, with 8 points and a 5-card suit, should make a positive response, 2♠.

SOUTH shows the ♠ support first, to set the trump suit, and to give NORTH an opportunity

for a move toward slam if he wants to do so.

NORTH would now make a Control-showing bid IF HE HAD A CONTROL. Since he doesn't he just returns

to 4♠ which SOUTH passes.}

{NORTH opens 2♣ and SOUTH responds 2

showing fewer than 8 points.

NORTH bids 2NT with a 23 point balanced hand.

SOUTH has enough points to bid 3NT, but with two 4-card Major suits bids 3♣ Stayman instead. NORTH

won't confuse this as the second negative since that bid isn't used after a 2NT rebid.

So NORTH shows her 4-card

suit and SOUTH bids 4

{SOUTH has a balanced hand with 11 points, so she responds 2NT to NORTH's 2♣ opening bid.

NORTH bids 3NT. This shows 22-24 points, a hand he was planning to rebid 2NT.

SOUTH knows the side has at least 33 points, but no more than 35 so she bids 6NT.}
