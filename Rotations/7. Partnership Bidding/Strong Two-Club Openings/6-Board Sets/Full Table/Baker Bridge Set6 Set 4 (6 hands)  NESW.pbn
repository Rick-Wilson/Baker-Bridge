{After SOUTH's 2♣ opening, NORTH bids 2NT, showing a balanced hand of at least 8 points. NORTH

actually has 12 points, but the time to show the extra strength will be later.

SOUTH's 3♣ bid is Stayman, asking NORTH for a 4-card Major. NORTH mentions his ♠s and

SOUTH bids 4♠, showing a minimum 2♣ opener with 4 ♠s.

Now NORTH adds his 12 points to SOUTH's 22 minimum and gets 34. He bids 6♠.}

{NORTH expected to open 2♣, then bid 2NT at her second turn.

But SOUTH, with 8 points and a balanced hand, responds 2NT, so NORTH must adapt. She shows

her minimum, balanced, 22-point hand by bidding 3NT.

Since NORTH has just the 8 points minimum that he promised, he passes 3NT.}
