{SOUTH has 5 points, so she responds 2

♦

to NORTH's opening 2♣ bid.

NORTH bids his 5-card ♠ suit.

SOUTH is too good for the second negative, so she supports NORTH's ♠.

NORTH doesn't have enough to think about slam, so he signs off at 4♠.}

{WEST opens 2♣ with her balanced 25 points.

EAST has 9 points but no 5-card suit. He should make a positive response of 2NT.

WEST figures EAST for 8 points and bids 6NT. If EAST has significantly more than

8 it will be up to him to go to 7NT. But he doesn't.}

{After EAST's 2♣ opening, WEST bids 2NT, showing a balanced hand of at least 8 points. WEST

actually has 12 points, but the time to show the extra strength will be later.

EAST's 3♣ bid is Stayman, asking WEST for a 4-card Major. WEST mentions his ♠s and

EAST bids 4♠, showing a minimum 2♣ opener with 4 ♠s.

Now WEST adds his 12 points to EAST's 22 minimum and gets 34. He bids 6♠.}
