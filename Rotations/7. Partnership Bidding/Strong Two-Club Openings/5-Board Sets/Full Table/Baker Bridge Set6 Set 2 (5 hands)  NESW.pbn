With 8 points, EAST can make a positive response so he bids his 5-card

WEST likes

s, knows there are at least 33 points, but needs to make

sure the opponents don't have two Aces so she uses Blackwood.

{EAST has a minimum 2♣ opening.

WEST, with 8 points and a 5-card suit, should make a positive response, 2♠.

EAST shows the ♠ support first, to set the trump suit, and to give WEST an opportunity

for a move toward slam if he wants to do so.

WEST would now make a Control-showing bid IF HE HAD A CONTROL. Since he doesn't he just returns

to 4♠ which EAST passes.}
