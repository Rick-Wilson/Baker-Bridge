{SOUTH has 5 points, so she responds 2

♦

to NORTH's opening 2♣ bid.

NORTH bids his 5-card ♠ suit.

SOUTH is too good for the second negative, so she supports NORTH's ♠.

NORTH doesn't have enough to think about slam, so he signs off at 4♠.}

{NORTH opens 2♣ with her balanced 25 points.

SOUTH has 9 points but no 5-card suit. He should make a positive response of 2NT.

NORTH figures SOUTH for 8 points and bids 6NT. If SOUTH has significantly more than

8 it will be up to him to go to 7NT. But he doesn't.}

{After NORTH's 2♣ opening, SOUTH bids 2NT, showing a balanced hand of at least 8 points. SOUTH

actually has 12 points, but the time to show the extra strength will be later.

NORTH's 3♣ bid is Stayman, asking SOUTH for a 4-card Major. SOUTH mentions his ♠s and

NORTH bids 4♠, showing a minimum 2♣ opener with 4 ♠s.

Now SOUTH adds his 12 points to NORTH's 22 minimum and gets 34. He bids 6♠.}
