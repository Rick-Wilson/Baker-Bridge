{NORTH has a perfect hand for an opening bid of 2♣.

23 points and balanced distribution is just fine.

SOUTH is glad to hear his partner has lots of points, because he was shortchanged.

However, he must answer, so with 1 point he bids a negative 2

♦

.

NORTH describes her hand by saying 2NT.

SOUTH does not have to bid the double negative over a 2NT bid, so he passes.}

SOUTH does NOT rebid the ♠s; his first bid already promised a 5-card suit. He just

bids 3NT.}
