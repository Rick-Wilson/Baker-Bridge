s, knows there are at least 33 points, but needs to make

sure the opponents don't have two Aces so she uses Blackwood.

{NORTH has a minimum 2♣ opening.

SOUTH, with 8 points and a 5-card suit, should make a positive response, 2♠.

NORTH shows the ♠ support first, to set the trump suit, and to give SOUTH an opportunity

for a move toward slam if he wants to do so.

SOUTH would now make a Control-showing bid IF HE HAD A CONTROL. Since he doesn't he just returns

to 4♠ which NORTH passes.}
