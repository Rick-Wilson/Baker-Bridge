{SOUTH has a perfect hand for an opening bid of 2♣.

23 points and balanced distribution is just fine.

NORTH is glad to hear his partner has lots of points, because he was shortchanged.

However, he must answer, so with 1 point he bids a negative 2

♦

.

SOUTH describes her hand by saying 2NT.

NORTH does not have to bid the double negative over a 2NT bid, so he passes.}

NORTH has 8 points AND a 5-card ♠ suit. This is strong enough for a positive response, so

he bids 2♠.

NORTH does NOT rebid the ♠s; his first bid already promised a 5-card suit. He just

bids 3NT.}
