{NORTH expected to open 2♣, then bid 2NT at her second turn.

But SOUTH, with 8 points and a balanced hand, responds 2NT, so NORTH must adapt. She shows

her minimum, balanced, 22-point hand by bidding 3NT.

Since NORTH has just the 8 points minimum that he promised, he passes 3NT.}

{When NORTH opens 2♣ SOUTH has enough strength (9 points) for a positive response. But,

because her suit is

♦

s, she must jump to 3

♦

.

NORTH thinks slam and uses Blackwood to discover that SOUTH holds one Ace.

That's all SOUTH needs to know to bid 6

♦
