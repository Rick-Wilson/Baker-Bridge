{SOUTH has a minimum 2♣ opening.

NORTH, with 8 points and a 5-card suit, should make a positive response, 2♠.

SOUTH shows the ♠ support first, to set the trump suit, and to give NORTH an opportunity

for a move toward slam if he wants to do so.

NORTH would now make a Control-showing bid IF HE HAD A CONTROL. Since he doesn't he just returns

to 4♠ which SOUTH passes.}

{WEST, with 22 points and balanced, opens 2♣, expecting to rebid 2NT.

But EAST responds a positive 2NT, showing a balanced hand with 8 or more points.

WEST bids what his hand is worth, 3NT and EAST passes.}

{SOUTH opens 2♣ and NORTH responds 2

♦

showing fewer than 8 points.

SOUTH bids 2NT with a 23 point balanced hand.

NORTH has enough points to bid 3NT, but with two 4-card Major suits bids 3♣ Stayman instead. SOUTH

won't confuse this as the second negative since that bid isn't used after a 2NT rebid.

So SOUTH shows her 4-card

♥

suit and NORTH bids 4

{WEST has a balanced hand with 11 points, so she responds 2NT to EAST's 2♣ opening bid.

EAST bids 3NT. This shows 22-24 points, a hand he was planning to rebid 2NT.

WEST knows the side has at least 33 points, but no more than 35 so she bids 6NT.}
