{SOUTH opens 2♣ with her balanced 25 points.

NORTH has 9 points but no 5-card suit. He should make a positive response of 2NT.

SOUTH figures NORTH for 8 points and bids 6NT. If NORTH has significantly more than

8 it will be up to him to go to 7NT. But he doesn't.}

{After NORTH's 2♣ opening, SOUTH bids 2NT, showing a balanced hand of at least 8 points. SOUTH

actually has 12 points, but the time to show the extra strength will be later.

NORTH's 3♣ bid is Stayman, asking SOUTH for a 4-card Major. SOUTH mentions his ♠s and

NORTH bids 4♠, showing a minimum 2♣ opener with 4 ♠s.

Now SOUTH adds his 12 points to NORTH's 22 minimum and gets 34. He bids 6♠.}
