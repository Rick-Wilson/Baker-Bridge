when she hears NORTH's positive

response. BUT, she should use Blackwood first.

It's good thing she did because NORTH admits to only one Ace - they are missing two Aces.}

{WEST not only has 20 points, he also has a lot of winners.

So when EAST jumps to 2NT, showing 13-15 points, WEST uses Gerber.

EAST shows two Aces so WEST decides 6NT will be just right.}

{When NORTH gives immediate ♠ support, SOUTH's thoughts naturally

turn to slam. This is a good hand to use Blackwood on, so SOUTH bids 4NT.

NORTH's 5

♦

answer shows one Ace, which SOUTH cleverly deduces

must be the ♣A.

SOUTH bids 6♠ since NORTH has not bid strongly enough to think about 7.}

WEST then bids 3♠, showing first round control. EAST tries 4NT (Blackwood) and

WEST replies 6♣. This shows a ♣ void and one Ace, obviously the ♠A.
