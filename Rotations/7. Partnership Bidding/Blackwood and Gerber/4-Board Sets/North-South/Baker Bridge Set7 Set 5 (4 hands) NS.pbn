[Result ""]
{NORTH is just shy of a 2♣ opening bid, and when SOUTH shows 13-15 points NORTH

wants to be in a slam.

NORTH cannot use Blackwood because 4NT would be a natural invitation, but with SOUTH's latest bid

being 2NT he can use Gerber.

Two Major Aces and two Minor Kings fill the holes in NORTH's hand so he bids 7NT.}

{NORTH thinks slam may be possible, so she uses Blackwood.

And that's what Blackwood is really good for - keeping you out of slams when you are

missing two Aces!}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH knows NORTH has at least five ♠s, and they might provide discards for two or three

of her minor suit losers.

She tries Blackwood and, sure enough, NORTH comes through with two Aces.

Even with all the Aces SOUTH knows there are not enough points for Grand,

so she bids 6
