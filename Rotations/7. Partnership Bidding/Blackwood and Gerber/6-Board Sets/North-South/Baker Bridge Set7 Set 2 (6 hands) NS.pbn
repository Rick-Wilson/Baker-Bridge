{When SOUTH gives immediate ♠ support, NORTH's thoughts naturally

turn to slam. This is a good hand to use Blackwood on, so NORTH bids 4NT.

SOUTH's 5

answer shows one Ace, which NORTH cleverly deduces

must be the ♣A.

NORTH bids 6♠ since SOUTH has not bid strongly enough to think about 7.}

If he uses Blackwood and NORTH shows two Aces he will be no better off, because he won't know if one

he bids 6
