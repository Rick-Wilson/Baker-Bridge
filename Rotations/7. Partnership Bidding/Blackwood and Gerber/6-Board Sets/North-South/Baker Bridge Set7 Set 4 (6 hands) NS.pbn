{SOUTH knows NORTH has at least five ♠s, and they might provide discards for two or three

of her minor suit losers.

She tries Blackwood and, sure enough, NORTH comes through with two Aces.

Even with all the Aces SOUTH knows there are not enough points for Grand,

so she bids 6

supply five tricks so she bids 7
