He starts with a Gerber 4♣ and NORTH shows three Aces.

Hmm, SOUTH can now count all thirteen tricks, so he forgets about the

{WEST has 13 points and can contribute six tricks so she figures that twelve tricks will be a slam (dunk).

However, just to make sure the opponents don't take the first two tricks she checks with Gerber.

Uh Oh, missing two Aces she signs off at 4NT. She could also happily play 5♣, but it

would be tricky to get there. Very tricky.}

{Yes, this has nothing to do with Gerber or Blackwood, but everything to do with smart bidding.

NORTH has a 16 points and SOUTH has 15, 16 or 17. NORTH wants to be in 6NT if SOUTH has 17,

but merely a Notrump game if she has 15 or 16.

The way to find out is to bid 4NT - not Blackwood but merely an invitation to bid 6NT.

In this case, SOUTH has but 15 points and declines the invitation. If her

A she would bid 6NT and collect her twelve easy tricks.}

{When WEST opens 1NT EAST hopes his hand includes all four Aces so she can bid 7NT.

So she uses Gerber to find out.

But, when she discovers they are missing an Ace she settles for 6NT.}

{WEST is just shy of a 2♣ opening bid, and when EAST shows 13-15 points WEST

wants to be in a slam.

WEST cannot use Blackwood because 4NT would be a natural invitation, but with EAST's latest bid

being 2NT he can use Gerber.

Two Major Aces and two Minor Kings fill the holes in WEST's hand so he bids 7NT.}
