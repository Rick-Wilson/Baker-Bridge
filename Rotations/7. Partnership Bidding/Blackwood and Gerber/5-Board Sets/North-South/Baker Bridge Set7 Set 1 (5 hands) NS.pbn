{SOUTH's 3♠ supporting bid is enough to convince NORTH to make a slam try.

NORTH bids Blackwood 4NT. If SOUTH shows one Ace NORTH plans to bid 6♠, but

when SOUTH bids 5♣ NORTH settles for 5♠}

{SOUTH makes a positive 3

response to NORTH's 2♣ opener.

This promises at least 8 points and a 5-card suit with two or more honors.

NORTH only needs to know one thing - how many Aces in the SOUTH hand.

A Blackwood 4NT tells her the answer is one, so she bids 6

{When NORTH opens 1NT, point-count alone tells SOUTH that 6NT can surely be made.

NORTH is bound to hold at least two Aces. But SOUTH doesn't want to miss a Grand slam.

SOUTH bids 4♣, (Gerber), and NORTH admits to just two Aces.

So SOUTH settles for the small slam.}

{SOUTH has a powerhouse and knows she will reach a slam somewhere. When NORTH

supports the ♠s, it seems she has found her spot.

Blackwood tells her that NORTH has two Aces.

She can see there are 12 tricks available and decides to take a chance that

NORTH will have a thirteenth trick somewhere among his opening hand points.

She bids 7NT.}
