{NORTH not only has 20 points, he also has a lot of winners.

So when SOUTH jumps to 2NT, showing 13-15 points, NORTH uses Gerber.

SOUTH shows two Aces so NORTH decides 6NT will be just right.}

{When NORTH gives immediate ♠ support, SOUTH's thoughts naturally

turn to slam. This is a good hand to use Blackwood on, so SOUTH bids 4NT.

NORTH's 5

answer shows one Ace, which SOUTH cleverly deduces

must be the ♣A.

SOUTH bids 6♠ since NORTH has not bid strongly enough to think about 7.}
