{SOUTH's 3♠ supporting bid is enough to convince NORTH to make a slam try.

NORTH bids Blackwood 4NT. If SOUTH shows one Ace NORTH plans to bid 6♠, but

when SOUTH bids 5♣ NORTH settles for 5♠}

{EAST makes a positive 3

response to WEST's 2♣ opener.

This promises at least 8 points and a 5-card suit with two or more honors.

WEST only needs to know one thing - how many Aces in the EAST hand.

A Blackwood 4NT tells her the answer is one, so she bids 6

{When SOUTH opens 1NT, point-count alone tells NORTH that 6NT can surely be made.

SOUTH is bound to hold at least two Aces. But NORTH doesn't want to miss a Grand slam.

NORTH bids 4♣, (Gerber), and SOUTH admits to just two Aces.

So NORTH settles for the small slam.}

{WEST has a powerhouse and knows she will reach a slam somewhere. When EAST

supports the ♠s, it seems she has found her spot.

Blackwood tells her that EAST has two Aces.

She can see there are 12 tricks available and decides to take a chance that

EAST will have a thirteenth trick somewhere among his opening hand points.

She bids 7NT.}

It's good thing she did because NORTH admits to only one Ace - they are missing two Aces.}
