{SOUTH not only has 20 points, he also has a lot of winners.

So when NORTH jumps to 2NT, showing 13-15 points, SOUTH uses Gerber.

NORTH shows two Aces so SOUTH decides 6NT will be just right.}

{When WEST gives immediate ♠ support, EAST's thoughts naturally

turn to slam. This is a good hand to use Blackwood on, so EAST bids 4NT.

WEST's 5

answer shows one Ace, which EAST cleverly deduces

must be the ♣A.

EAST bids 6♠ since WEST has not bid strongly enough to think about 7.}
