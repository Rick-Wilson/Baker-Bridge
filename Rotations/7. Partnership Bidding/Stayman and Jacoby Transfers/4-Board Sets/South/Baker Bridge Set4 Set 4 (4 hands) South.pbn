{Because SOUTH holds a 4-card Major suit, (

s), he starts his

responses with Stayman.

NORTH denies holding any 4-card Major suit so SOUTH gives up on

s.

He next bids ♠s, showing five of them. He jumps to 3♠, giving NORTH the choice

between 4♠ or 3NT.

With three trumps NORTH chooses 4♠.}

{NORTH has a poor 9 points, but does have two 4-card Majors. So he uses Stayman.

When SOUTH bids ♠s, NORTH isn't strong enough to bid game herself, so she temporizes

with a 3♠ invitation.

SOUTH has a full 17 points so he accepts the invitation.}

{NORTH, with 9 points and a 6-card suit, knows they should play in ♠s.

The question is: how high?

NORTH transfers SOUTH to ♠s, then invites by raising to 3♠.

SOUTH has only two trumps, (good ones, admittedly), but she has a maximum 17 point hand.

So she bids the ♠ game.}
