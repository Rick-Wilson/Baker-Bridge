{NORTH has a rotten hand, and many players would just pass 1NT.

But NORTH figures that having SOUTH play any 4-4 fit would be better than 1NT so

he bids 2♣, Stayman. This is called "Garbage Stayman", and you can see why.

SOUTH bids 2

[Result ""]
{Just having a 4-card Major doesn't mean you must automatically use Stayman.

Here NORTH has a 4-card ♠ suit, but decides not to seek a 4-4 fit because his

hand wouldn't have any ruffing values in a ♠ contract. He bids 3NT.

Notice that even though SOUTH also has four ♠s the 4-4 fit is not useful to them in

a ♠ contract because neither hand can ruff any losers.}

{NORTH has an invitational (9 point) hand with five ♠s.

She bids it in the standard way - first transfer SOUTH to ♠s, then invite

the game by bidding 2NT.

SOUTH, with 17 points and three ♠s, accepts the game invitation and chooses 4♠.}
