First SOUTH bids 2

Then, after NORTH bids the obligatory 2♠, SOUTH jumps to 4

enough strength for game, and also five

s to go with the five ♠s.

NORTH prefers ♠s, so she corrects the contract to 4♠.}

{With 12 points and five ♠s, when WEST hears her partner open 1NT she knows

there is a game - either 3NT or 4♠.

WEST first transfers EAST to ♠s, then jumps to 3NT, giving EAST the choice.

EAST has three ♠s, so he chooses 4♠, taking the 8-card Major fit.}
