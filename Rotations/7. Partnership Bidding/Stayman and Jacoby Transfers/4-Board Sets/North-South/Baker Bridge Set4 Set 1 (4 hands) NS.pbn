{NORTH, with 11 points and six ♠s, knows immediately that the final contract will be 4♠

since the partners must have at least eight ♠s and at least 26 points.

She concludes that it might be better for SOUTH to be the Declarer so she bids 2

♥

as a Jacoby Transfer. When SOUTH makes the required 2♠ bid she just bids 4♠ which

closes the auction with SOUTH as Declarer.}

must have at least a doubleton. He also knows the partnership holds at least 27 points.

He prefers NORTH be the Declarer, (to protect against

the opening lead), so he uses a Jacoby Transfer.

The contract might go down if played by SOUTH, but is odds on when played by NORTH.}
