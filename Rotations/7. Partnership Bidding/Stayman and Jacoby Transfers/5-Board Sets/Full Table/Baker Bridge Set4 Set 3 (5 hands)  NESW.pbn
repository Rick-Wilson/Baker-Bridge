But, the contract should be played from the NORTH side so the opening lead doesn't go through any vulnerable

SOUTH transfers NORTH to

off two Aces. Missing one Ace he settles for 6

With no

EAST declines.}

{Because SOUTH holds a 4-card Major suit, (

s), he starts his

responses with Stayman.

NORTH denies holding any 4-card Major suit so SOUTH gives up on

s.

He next bids ♠s, showing five of them. He jumps to 3♠, giving NORTH the choice

between 4♠ or 3NT.

With three trumps NORTH chooses 4♠.}

{EAST has a poor 9 points, but does have two 4-card Majors. So he uses Stayman.

When WEST bids ♠s, EAST isn't strong enough to bid game herself, so she temporizes

with a 3♠ invitation.

WEST has a full 17 points so he accepts the invitation.}

{SOUTH, with 9 points and a 6-card suit, knows they should play in ♠s.

The question is: how high?

SOUTH transfers NORTH to ♠s, then invites by raising to 3♠.

NORTH has only two trumps, (good ones, admittedly), but she has a maximum 17 point hand.

So she bids the ♠ game.}
