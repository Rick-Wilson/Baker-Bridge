{NORTH, with a balanced 17 point hand naturally opens 1NT.

SOUTH has a really awful hand, but she does hold six ♠s.

So she uses Jacoby Transfer, and when NORTH bids 2♠ she passes!}

{Stayman convention works just fine after a 2NT opening, just at a higher level.

SOUTH knows that 6 points will be enough for game opposite NORTH's 20-21, she just

needs to find out if there is a 4-4 Major suit fit. There is, in ♠s.}

{NORTH has five cards in each Major and SOUTH opens 1NT.

First NORTH bids 2

, indicating a 5-card ♠ suit with the Transfer bid.

Then, after SOUTH bids the obligatory 2♠, NORTH jumps to 4

, promising

enough strength for game, and also five

s to go with the five ♠s.

SOUTH prefers ♠s, so she corrects the contract to 4♠.}

{With 12 points and five ♠s, when SOUTH hears her partner open 1NT she knows

there is a game - either 3NT or 4♠.

SOUTH first transfers NORTH to ♠s, then jumps to 3NT, giving NORTH the choice.

NORTH has three ♠s, so he chooses 4♠, taking the 8-card Major fit.}
