But, the contract should be played from the NORTH side so the opening lead doesn't go through any vulnerable

SOUTH transfers NORTH to

off two Aces. Missing one Ace he settles for 6

With no

SOUTH declines.}

{Because NORTH holds a 4-card Major suit, (

responses with Stayman.

SOUTH denies holding any 4-card Major suit so NORTH gives up on

s.

He next bids ♠s, showing five of them. He jumps to 3♠, giving SOUTH the choice

between 4♠ or 3NT.

With three trumps SOUTH chooses 4♠.}

{NORTH has a poor 9 points, but does have two 4-card Majors. So he uses Stayman.

When SOUTH bids ♠s, NORTH isn't strong enough to bid game herself, so she temporizes

with a 3♠ invitation.

SOUTH has a full 17 points so he accepts the invitation.}

{SOUTH, with 9 points and a 6-card suit, knows they should play in ♠s.

The question is: how high?

SOUTH transfers NORTH to ♠s, then invites by raising to 3♠.

NORTH has only two trumps, (good ones, admittedly), but she has a maximum 17 point hand.

So she bids the ♠ game.}
