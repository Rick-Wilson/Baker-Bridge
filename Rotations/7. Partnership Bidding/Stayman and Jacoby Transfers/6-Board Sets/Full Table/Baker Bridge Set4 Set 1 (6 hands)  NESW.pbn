{WEST, with 11 points and six ♠s, knows immediately that the final contract will be 4♠

since the partners must have at least eight ♠s and at least 26 points.

She concludes that it might be better for EAST to be the Declarer so she bids 2

as a Jacoby Transfer. When EAST makes the required 2♠ bid she just bids 4♠ which

closes the auction with EAST as Declarer.}
