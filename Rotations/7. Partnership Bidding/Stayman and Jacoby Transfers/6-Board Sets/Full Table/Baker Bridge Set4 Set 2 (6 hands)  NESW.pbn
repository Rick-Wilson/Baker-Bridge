{Stayman convention works just fine after a 2NT opening, just at a higher level.

WEST knows that 6 points will be enough for game opposite EAST's 20-21, she just

needs to find out if there is a 4-4 Major suit fit. There is, in ♠s.}

First NORTH bids 2

Then, after SOUTH bids the obligatory 2♠, NORTH jumps to 4

enough strength for game, and also five

s to go with the five ♠s.

SOUTH prefers ♠s, so she corrects the contract to 4♠.}

WEST has three ♠s, so he chooses 4♠, taking the 8-card Major fit.}
