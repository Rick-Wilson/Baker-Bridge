final contract anyway.

But it doesn't hurt to bid 2

(Fourth Suit Forcing) just to

see if SOUTH happens to have three ♠s. She does, so 4♠ becomes the better game.}

at his second turn.

WEST uses the 2

EAST should first show a 4-card

suit, and next show 3-card ♠ support.

Change EAST's

9 to the ♠9 and the contract would be 4♠.}

bid is a Help Suit Game Try.

NORTH barely had enough strength to respond in the first place, but revaluing the hand,

(and particularly the singleton

), makes it worth a
