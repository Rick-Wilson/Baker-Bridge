{NORTH could make a Help Suit Game Try in either ♠s or ♣s.

But she doesn't need the ♠ help as much as she does in ♣s, so she chooses ♣s.

SOUTH doesn't have a strong hand but has excellent help in ♣s

so he bids the game.}

{Could EAST bid 2

, (FSF), even though she actually has the suit?

Perhaps, but there is no reason to do so. WEST does not have four

s

or he would have mentioned them before bidding ♠s.

EAST should ignore the

♥

suit and bid 3NT.}

Fourth Suit Forcing and wouldn't show the

suit at all.

With a game-forcing two-suiter he jumps to 3

NORTH recognizes that SOUTH must hold five ♠s and bids the ♠ game.}

{EAST bids 2♣ as New Minor Forcing, hoping WEST has three

WEST does not have three

♥

s and he has no other bid to make that

will describe his hand any better. He cannot bid Notrump again without a ♣ stopper.

So WEST rebids the 5-card

♦

suit.

EAST has nowhere to go, so passes.}
