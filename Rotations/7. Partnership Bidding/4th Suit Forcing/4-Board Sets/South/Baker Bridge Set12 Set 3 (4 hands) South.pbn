{SOUTH's 3

bid is a Help Suit Game Try.

NORTH barely had enough strength to respond in the first place, but revaluing the hand,

(and particularly the singleton

), makes it worth a

raise to game.}

{SOUTH has no reason to consider Fourth Suit Forcing with this hand.

NORTH does not have four ♠s or he would have already supported.

So SOUTH should bid the Notrump game.}

three ♠s, but he does have ♣s stopped so he bids 2NT, which North raises to 3NT.}
