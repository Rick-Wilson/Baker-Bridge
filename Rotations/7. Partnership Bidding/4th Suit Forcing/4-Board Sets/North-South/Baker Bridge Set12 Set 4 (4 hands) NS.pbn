{NORTH cannot see a game unless SOUTH has help in ♣s so she makes a Help Suit Game Try.

SOUTH has 8 points and the doubleton ♣ K Q so he bids the game.}

{NORTH has a perfect hand on which to use Fourth Suit Forcing. If South can stop

♠s, then 3NT would be a great contract.

There is one problem - if NORTH bids 1♠ at her second turn it is NOT considered

FSF, so she must jump to 2♠.

SOUTH, win a fine ♠ stopper, bids 3NT.}

{SOUTH's 2

♦

bid is a perfect example of NMF.

It provides NORTH with the opportunity to show either a 4-card

♥

suit,

OR 3-card ♠ support.

In this hand NORTH actually has both. When that happens, showing the

♥

s is

first priority.}

{SOUTH's 1♠ bid is definitely forcing, but it is not FSF. In this one instance, all

bids at the one level, the ♠ bid shows a real suit.

So NORTH shows the 4-card support and SOUTH bids game.}
