NORTH replies to the 4NT bid with 5

So which is it, zero or three?

Pretty simple - since SOUTH holds three Keycards himself NORTH can hardly have three also since there

are only five total. She must have zero and SOUTH signs off at 5

SOUTH bid much too strongly to have no Aces. NORTH

bids a confident 6♠, knowing SOUTH has either three Aces or two Aces plus the ♠K.}
