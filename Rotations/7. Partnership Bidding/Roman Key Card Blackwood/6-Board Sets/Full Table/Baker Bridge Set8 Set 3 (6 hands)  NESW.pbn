{When NORTH makes a slam try with a jump to 3♠, the best approach for SOUTH is to agree on

the trump suit immediately but indicate a minimum hand by bidding 4♠.

NORTH's next move is logical; RKCB 4NT.

SOUTH shows zero or three Key Cards, and since it could not possibly be zero, NORTH knows they are

the ♠K and both red Aces. Even possessing all the Key Cards NORTH knows there aren't

enough points for a Grand slam.}

{SOUTH has 21 points, and when she hears NORTH make a limit raise she tries for slam with RKCB.

NORTH answers with just one Key Card so SOUTH stops at 5♠, knowing they are missing

two Key Cards.

Of course she didn't expect the two missing Key Cards to be the Ace and King of trumps!}

{What is this doing here in the RKCB Practice Pages?

To emphasize that there are many 4NT bids which are NOT asking for Aces.

In this case, WEST showed a balanced hand with 18 or 19 points, and EAST invited him

to bid 6NT if he felt his hand was a "maximum". He didn't, so he passed.}

{WEST thinks they should be in slam, and uses Stayman to check for a 4-4 Major fit.

When EAST announces four ♠s WEST uses RKCB 4NT.

EAST's 5♠ bid shows two Key Cards plus the ♠Q.

This fills the holes in WEST's hand nicely, so she bids 6♠.}
