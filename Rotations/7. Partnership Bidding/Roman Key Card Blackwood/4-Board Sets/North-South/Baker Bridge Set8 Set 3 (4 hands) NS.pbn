{NORTH's positive response shows 8+ points and five or more cards headed by at least two honors.

SOUTH figures a small slam would be safe, but just to be sure she uses Blackwood.

NORTH's 6

♦

reply shows one Key-card which must be the trump King,

and a

♦

void!

.

SOUTH readjusts her thinking and decides to bid the Grand.}

{SOUTH jumps in

s, showing a good suit and slam interest.

NORTH has great

support so bids RKCB 4NT.

SOUTH responds 5♠, showing two Key Cards and the

Q.

That is enough for NORTH to bid the slam.}

{When SOUTH agrees to ♠s, NORTH will not stop short of a slam.

The RKCB 4NT bid tells NORTH that they have all five Key Cards since SOUTH could hardly

have a 2♣ opening hand with no Aces.

NORTH's 5

♥

bid is the Queen Ask, and SOUTH's reply confirms that she holds

the ♠Q, and also has the ♣K.

NORTH figures the ♠ suit will run, and this should be enough for Grand Slam. He chooses 7NT.}

{SOUTH knows there are enough points for slam, but she is worried about the trump suit.

NORTH's support doesn't guarantee more than three ♠s, and if they are not headed

by the Queen she could lose a trump trick.

Her RKCB bid relieves her mind when SOUTH claims two Key Cards PLUS the ♠Q.

She bids 6♠ (and hopes for a 3-2 trump split!).}
