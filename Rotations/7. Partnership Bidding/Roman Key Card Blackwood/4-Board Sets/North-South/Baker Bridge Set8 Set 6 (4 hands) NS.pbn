{NORTH realizes SOUTH has fewer than 8 points, but the 3♠ support bid is enough

for her to try a RKCB 4NT bid.

SOUTH shows two Key Cards and NORTH figures they will be the ♠K and one of the

red Aces. So she bids 6♠. If instead the Key Cards are the two red Aces NORTH

might possibly make all thirteen tricks with a finesse.}

bid is "encouraging" so SOUTH bids 4NT.

When NORTH shows one Key Card, (an Ace), SOUTH is afraid he may have a trump loser as well the

other Ace. To find out about the

bids 5

, the Queen Ask.

NORTH has the

{This is the companion to Deal 22.

Again, worried about a possible trump loser in addition to the missing Ace, NORTH

bids 5

, the Queen Ask.

SOUTH definitely does NOT have the

♥

Q. But with five trumps she

does know that NORTH probably does not have a trump loser so she jumps

to 6

anyway.}

{NORTH cannot use RKCB at her second bid because trumps have not been agreed. So she bids

3

to set trumps, knowing SOUTH cannot pass after her jump-shift.

SOUTH tries to stop at game but NORTH is too strong so she now uses RKCB and gets

to 6

when SOUTH shows two Key Cards and the trump Queen.}
