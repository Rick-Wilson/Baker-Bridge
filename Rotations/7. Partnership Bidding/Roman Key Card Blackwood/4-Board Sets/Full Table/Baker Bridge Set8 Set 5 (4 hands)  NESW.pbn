{When SOUTH makes a Splinter bid, showing

support and ♣ shortness,

NORTH naturally thinks about slam.

She uses RKCB 4NT, and SOUTH, with one Key Card and a ♣ Void, bids 6♣.

Just what NORTH needed for the 6

bid.}

{WEST thinks they should be in slam, and uses Stayman to check for a 4-4 Major fit.

When EAST announces four ♠s WEST uses RKCB 4NT.

EAST's 5♠ bid shows two Key Cards plus the ♠Q.

This fills the holes in WEST's hand nicely, so she bids 6♠.}

{This is the companion hand to Deal 18.

Again, NORTH uses RKCB after the 4-4 ♠ fit is discovered.

This time SOUTH shows two Key Cards without the ♠Q.

Now NORTH realizes that in addition to one outside Ace, there is a very possible loser

in trumps. So she stops at 5♠.}

2H pass 2NT pass 3NT pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{The chances of a slam on this hand are very small, and if WEST decides to use RKCB it will

just confuse matters when EAST shows two Key Cards.

WEST has a better way to find out about the hand. She bids 2NT asking EAST to further describe

his hand. EAST should then bid 3NT, showing a solid suit headed by AKQ.

EAST cannot have as much as an extra Jack, so WEST just passes 3NT.}
