{WEST has a decent Limit Raise, and EAST tries RKC Blackwood.

WEST replies to the 4NT bid with 5

, zero or three Keycards.

So which is it, zero or three?

Pretty simple - since EAST holds three Keycards himself WEST can hardly have three also since there

are only five total. She must have zero and EAST signs off at 5

[Result ""]
{NORTH jumps to 4♠, confident that SOUTH could make 10 tricks

even if he just has 6 points.

SOUTH knows he can make more and bids RKCB 4NT.

NORTH's 5

♦

response shows zero or three Keycards.

So which is it? Zero or three?

NORTH bid much too strongly to have no Aces. SOUTH

bids a confident 6♠, knowing NORTH has either three Aces or two Aces plus the ♠K.}
