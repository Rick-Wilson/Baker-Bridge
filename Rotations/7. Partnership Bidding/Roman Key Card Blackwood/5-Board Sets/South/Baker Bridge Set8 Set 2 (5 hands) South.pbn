{NORTH decides it is unlikely that SOUTH is Aceless, so all he wants to know is the number of Aces SOUTH does have.

He invokes RKC Blackwood.

Since no trump suit has been agreed, SOUTH bids as if

s, the

last-bid suit prior to 4NT is agreed. SOUTH has two Key-cards plus the trump Queen, so she bids 5♠.

NORTH bids 6

.

If SOUTH had just one Key-card, NORTH would bid 5

over the 5♣ reply.}

{This is the companion to Deal 6. The cards are the same except that the

♦

s and ♣s have been swapped.

Again, NORTH has no problem as long as SOUTH holds at least one Key-card.

When SOUTH responds 5♣, (showing one Key-card), NORTH can pass.

That's what happens here.}

{NORTH needs to know how many Aces SOUTH holds.

One way to find out would be to bid 3♠, (which is forcing), then launch Blackwood.

Another way is to bid 4♣ (Gerber) right now.

The first way is probably better but we needed a Gerber example.}

{SOUTH's positive response shows 8+ points and five or more cards headed by at least two honors.

NORTH figures a small slam would be safe, but just to be sure she uses Blackwood.

SOUTH's 6

♦

reply shows one Key-card which must be the trump King,

and a

♦

void!

.

NORTH readjusts her thinking and decides to bid the Grand.}

NORTH has great

That is enough for NORTH to bid the slam.}
