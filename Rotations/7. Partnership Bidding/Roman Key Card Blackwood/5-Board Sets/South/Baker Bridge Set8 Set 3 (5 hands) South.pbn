{When NORTH agrees to ♠s, SOUTH will not stop short of a slam.

The RKCB 4NT bid tells SOUTH that they have all five Key Cards since NORTH could hardly

have a 2♣ opening hand with no Aces.

SOUTH's 5

♥

bid is the Queen Ask, and NORTH's reply confirms that she holds

the ♠Q, and also has the ♣K.

SOUTH figures the ♠ suit will run, and this should be enough for Grand Slam. He chooses 7NT.}

{SOUTH knows there are enough points for slam, but she is worried about the trump suit.

NORTH's support doesn't guarantee more than three ♠s, and if they are not headed

by the Queen she could lose a trump trick.

Her RKCB bid relieves her mind when SOUTH claims two Key Cards PLUS the ♠Q.

She bids 6♠ (and hopes for a 3-2 trump split!).}

{When SOUTH makes a slam try with a jump to 3♠, the best approach for NORTH is to agree on

the trump suit immediately but indicate a minimum hand by bidding 4♠.

SOUTH's next move is logical; RKCB 4NT.

NORTH shows zero or three Key Cards, and since it could not possibly be zero, SOUTH knows they are

the ♠K and both red Aces. Even possessing all the Key Cards SOUTH knows there aren't

enough points for a Grand slam.}

{SOUTH has 21 points, and when she hears NORTH make a limit raise she tries for slam with RKCB.

NORTH answers with just one Key Card so SOUTH stops at 5♠, knowing they are missing

two Key Cards.

Of course she didn't expect the two missing Key Cards to be the Ace and King of trumps!}
