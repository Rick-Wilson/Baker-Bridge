{SOUTH has the strength for a raise to game in ♠s, but this could be dangerous since NORTH

has overcalled rather than opened. Instead, SOUTH shows her strength with a Support Cue-bid.

NORTH in fact had a pretty good overcall so he jumps to 3♠ and SOUTH bids the game.

With a weak overcall NORTH would have just returned to 2♠ which SOUTH would pass.}
