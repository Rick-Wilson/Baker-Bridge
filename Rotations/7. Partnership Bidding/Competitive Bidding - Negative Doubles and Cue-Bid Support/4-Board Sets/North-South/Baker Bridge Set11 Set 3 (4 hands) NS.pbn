SOUTH has 7 points, barely enough for a 2

But when EAST puts in the ♠ bid, SOUTH can jump to 3

as a preemptive

measure. He knows NORTH won't think he has strength because he did not make a Support Cue-bid.

NORTH does know it and passes 3

{NORTH has the strength for a raise to game in ♠s, but this could be dangerous since SOUTH

has overcalled rather than opened. Instead, NORTH shows her strength with a Support Cue-bid.

SOUTH in fact had a pretty good overcall so he jumps to 3♠ and NORTH bids the game.

With a weak overcall SOUTH would have just returned to 2♠ which NORTH would pass.}
