{NORTH has a perfect 1NT opener; a balanced hand with 16 points.

SOUTH has 7 points; he knows that the most points the partnership could hold is 24 (7 + 17).

Since this is below the 26 point game requirement he passes.}

{SOUTH has an ideal 1NT opening -

16 points and balanced distribution.

With 12 points, NORTH knows the partnership total is between 27 and 29, enough for game

but not enough to think about slam. Since NORTH also has a balanced hand she bids 3NT.}

{NORTH has 16 points and balanced distribution.

She naturally opens 1NT.

SOUTH has 14 points and balanced distribution so he does the math.

The partnership has at least 29 points (14 + 15).

The partnership has at most 31 points (14 + 17).

Since this is more than the 26 needed for game, but fewer than the 33 needed for slam

SOUTH just bids 3NT, knowing NORTH will respect his decision and pass.}

{NORTH has a maximum 17 point 1NT opener.

SOUTH has 9 points:

- if NORTH has 15 the total is 24, not enough for game.

- if NORTH has 17 the total is 26, enough for game.

Since SOUTH doesn't know what to do he passes the buck back to NORTH

by bidding 2NT; this is an invitation for NORTH to bid game.

NORTH has a maximum 17 point hand so she accepts the invitation.}

[Result ""]
{With 9 points NORTH is unable to decide the final contract. If SOUTH has 17 points then the partnership

should be playing 3NT. If SOUTH opened with just 15 points then 3NT will be too high..

So NORTH makes the temporizing bid of 2NT. This tells SOUTH that he must make the final call - go on to

game if he has maximum, pass if he has minimum. On this Deal SOUTH has 17 points so he bids 3NT.}
