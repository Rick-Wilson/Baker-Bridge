{This time SOUTH has a minimum 1NT opener; a balanced hand with 15 points.

NORTH has 9 points; he knows that the partnership is somewhere between

24 (9 + 15) and 26 (9 + 17). So he invites with a 2NT bid.

SOUTH, with a minimum, declines the invitation by passing.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has a strong hand, 20 points and balanced distribution.

It is just right to open 2NT (20-21 points).

NORTH adds her 2 points to SOUTH's promised number of 20 or 21. Since she doesn't reach the

magic game number of 26 points she just passes.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has an mid-range 1NT opener; a balanced hand with 16 points.

NORTH has 9 points. He bids 2NT, asking SOUTH to pass if she has 15 or bid 3NT if she has 17.

But SOUTH has 16 points, which leaves her with no clear choice.

In this case she must decide whether her hand is a "good" 16 points or a "poor" 16 points.

Since her supporting cards are mostly 10's, 9's and 8's she figures it as "good"

and bids 3NT.}

{SOUTH has 20 points and 4-4-3-2 distribution, so he opens 2NT.

NORTH has 8 points. She adds SOUTH's 20 or 21 for a total of 28 or 29, enough for game but

nowhere close to the slam requirement. So she bids 3NT and SOUTH passes.}

{SOUTH has a minimum 1NT opening hand - balanced distribution with 15 points.

NORTH has 9 points, which is not enough to bid game, but is worth making an invitational bid.

So she says 2NT.

Since SOUTH is minimum he declines the invitation by passing.}
