{SOUTH has a great 1NT hand - 17 points and 4-3-3-3 shape.

NORTH has 16 points; he figures it is possible that SOUTH can make a slam, but only

if she has a 17 point opener. So he bids 4NT, expecting SOUTH to bid 6NT if she has 17 points

but to pass if she has fewer.

He figured right - SOUTH had 17 points so she bid 6NT.}

{NORTH definitely does NOT have a balanced hand. She has two doubletons and a

6-card Club suit.

But she DOES have 18 points, (two extra for the fifth and sixth Clubs), and her 18 added to

SOUTH's minimum of 15 is enough to bid 6NT.

Notice how easy this will be to play once that Club suit is established.}

{With 21 points and 4-3-3-3 distribution, SOUTH opens 2NT.

NORTH has just 3 points; he knows that SOUTH cannot have more than 21 so the partnership

total cannot be more than 24. So he just passes 2NT.}

{This is an easy one to bid.

SOUTH has a balanced 16 points so he opens 1NT.

NORTH has a balanced 12 points so she responds 3NT.

BUT - just look at how this would play. You might only be able to take 8 tricks.

Sometimes correct bidding gets you to unmakeable contracts. But it's only a game.}

{Notrump bidding really is easy, you just add your points to partner's points and then

bid according to that answer.

Here NORTH has 14 points. So when SOUTH opens 2NT, showing 20 or 21 points NORTH knows the

total will come to 34 or 35 so he bids 6NT.}
