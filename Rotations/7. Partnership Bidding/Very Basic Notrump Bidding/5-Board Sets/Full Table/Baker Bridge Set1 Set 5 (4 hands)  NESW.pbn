{With 21 points and 4-3-3-3 distribution, NORTH opens 2NT.

SOUTH has just 3 points; he knows that NORTH cannot have more than 21 so the partnership

total cannot be more than 24. So he just passes 2NT.}

{This is an easy one to bid.

EAST has a balanced 16 points so he opens 1NT.

WEST has a balanced 12 points so she responds 3NT.

BUT - just look at how this would play. You might only be able to take 8 tricks.

Sometimes correct bidding gets you to unmakeable contracts. But it's only a game.}

{Notrump bidding really is easy, you just add your points to partner's points and then

bid according to that answer.

Here NORTH has 14 points. So when SOUTH opens 2NT, showing 20 or 21 points NORTH knows the

total will come to 34 or 35 so he bids 6NT.}
