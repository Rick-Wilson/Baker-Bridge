[Result ""]
{With 9 points SOUTH is unable to decide the final contract. If NORTH has 17 points then the partnership

should be playing 3NT. If NORTH opened with just 15 points then 3NT will be too high..

So SOUTH makes the temporizing bid of 2NT. This tells NORTH that he must make the final call - go on to

game if he has maximum, pass if he has minimum. On this Deal NORTH has 17 points so he bids 3NT.}

{This time EAST has a minimum 1NT opener; a balanced hand with 15 points.

WEST has 9 points; he knows that the partnership is somewhere between

24 (9 + 15) and 26 (9 + 17). So he invites with a 2NT bid.

EAST, with a minimum, declines the invitation by passing.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has a strong hand, 20 points and balanced distribution.

It is just right to open 2NT (20-21 points).

NORTH adds her 2 points to SOUTH's promised number of 20 or 21. Since she doesn't reach the

magic game number of 26 points she just passes.}

[Result ""]
{WEST has an mid-range 1NT opener; a balanced hand with 16 points.

EAST has 9 points. He bids 2NT, asking WEST to pass if she has 15 or bid 3NT if she has 17.

But WEST has 16 points, which leaves her with no clear choice.

In this case she must decide whether her hand is a "good" 16 points or a "poor" 16 points.

Since her supporting cards are mostly 10's, 9's and 8's she figures it as "good"

and bids 3NT.}

{NORTH has 20 points and 4-4-3-2 distribution, so he opens 2NT.

SOUTH has 8 points. She adds NORTH's 20 or 21 for a total of 28 or 29, enough for game but

nowhere close to the slam requirement. So she bids 3NT and NORTH passes.}
