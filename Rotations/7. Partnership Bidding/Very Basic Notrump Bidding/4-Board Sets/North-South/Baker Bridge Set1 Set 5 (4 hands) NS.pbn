SOUTH has 6 points, just enough to bid 3NT.

[Result ""]
{After NORTH passes initially, SOUTH opens 1NT.

With 9 points, NORTH has invitational strength, so he says 2NT.

SOUTH has a small problem - NORTH's bid tells her to bid 3NT with 17 points, but to pass

with 15 points. Her problem is that she has 16! Since it looks to her like a "good" 16 points

she bids 3NT. If those 10's and 9's had been 4's and 3's she would have passed.}

[Result ""]
{NORTH has a great 1NT hand - 17 points and 4-3-3-3 shape.

SOUTH has 16 points; he figures it is possible that NORTH can make a slam, but only

if she has a 17 point opener. So he bids 4NT, expecting NORTH to bid 6NT if she has 17 points

but to pass if she has fewer.

He figured right - NORTH had 17 points so she bid 6NT.}

{NORTH definitely does NOT have a balanced hand. She has two doubletons and a

6-card Club suit.

But she DOES have 18 points, (two extra for the fifth and sixth Clubs), and her 18 added to

SOUTH's minimum of 15 is enough to bid 6NT.

Notice how easy this will be to play once that Club suit is established.}
