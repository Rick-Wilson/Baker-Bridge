{SOUTH has a maximum 17 point 1NT opener.

NORTH has 9 points:

- if SOUTH has 15 the total is 24, not enough for game.

- if SOUTH has 17 the total is 26, enough for game.

Since NORTH doesn't know what to do he passes the buck back to SOUTH

by bidding 2NT; this is an invitation for SOUTH to bid game.

SOUTH has a maximum 17 point hand so she accepts the invitation.}

[Result ""]
{With 9 points NORTH is unable to decide the final contract. If SOUTH has 17 points then the partnership

should be playing 3NT. If SOUTH opened with just 15 points then 3NT will be too high..

So NORTH makes the temporizing bid of 2NT. This tells SOUTH that he must make the final call - go on to

game if he has maximum, pass if he has minimum. On this Deal SOUTH has 17 points so he bids 3NT.}

{This time SOUTH has a minimum 1NT opener; a balanced hand with 15 points.

NORTH has 9 points; he knows that the partnership is somewhere between

24 (9 + 15) and 26 (9 + 17). So he invites with a 2NT bid.

SOUTH, with a minimum, declines the invitation by passing.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has a strong hand, 20 points and balanced distribution.

It is just right to open 2NT (20-21 points).

NORTH adds her 2 points to SOUTH's promised number of 20 or 21. Since she doesn't reach the

magic game number of 26 points she just passes.}
