{The partner who is first sure what the final contract should be should just go ahead and bid it.

This is called "She who knows, goes."

In this deal, for example, it is WEST who knows. She has a balanced 14 points, so when EAST indicates

20/21 points with his opening 2NT bid she

KNOWS

the partnership holds about 34/35 points.

Therefore she

GOES

to 6NT.}

{SOUTH has a balanced 20 point hand - ideal to open 2NT.

NORTH has 7 points; he knows the partnership has either 27 or 28 points so he bids 3NT.}

{This is another example of "She who knows, goes."

EAST has a solid 18 points, (1 extra for the fifth Club), so when WEST opens 1NT

she

KNOWS

that together they must hold at least 33 points. The may even have 35 points.

In any case they should be in slam, so EAST

GOES

to 6NT.}
