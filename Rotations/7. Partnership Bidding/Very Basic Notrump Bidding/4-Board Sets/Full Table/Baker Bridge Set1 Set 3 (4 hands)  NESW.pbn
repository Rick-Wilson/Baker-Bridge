{NORTH has an mid-range 1NT opener; a balanced hand with 16 points.

SOUTH has 9 points. He bids 2NT, asking NORTH to pass if she has 15 or bid 3NT if she has 17.

But NORTH has 16 points, which leaves her with no clear choice.

In this case she must decide whether her hand is a "good" 16 points or a "poor" 16 points.

Since her supporting cards are mostly 10's, 9's and 8's she figures it as "good"

and bids 3NT.}

{EAST has 20 points and 4-4-3-2 distribution, so he opens 2NT.

WEST has 8 points. She adds EAST's 20 or 21 for a total of 28 or 29, enough for game but

nowhere close to the slam requirement. So she bids 3NT and EAST passes.}

[Result ""]
{WEST has a minimum 1NT opening hand - balanced distribution with 15 points.

EAST has 9 points, which is not enough to bid game, but is worth making an invitational bid.

So she says 2NT.

Since WEST is minimum he declines the invitation by passing.}
