{With a 5-card ♠ suit and 13 points NORTH should overcall 1♠.

SOUTH has 13 points and four ♠s. If NORTH had opened, SOUTH's hand would be good enough

to insist on game. But since NORTH overcalled, SOUTH merely invites with a jump to 3♠.

NORTH has better than a minimum overcall so she accepts the invitation and bids 4♠.}

He has 9 points and no 4-card suit of his own. This is the type of hand to respond 1NT.

SOUTH is happy to play Notrump now that she knows the

so she bids 3NT.}
