{SOUTH has an opening hand, 15 points, and a 5-card ♠ suit. Unfortunately EAST beat her to

the punch by opening 1

♥

.

But SOUTH should get into the bidding anyway, by Overcalling 1♠. This shows a good ♠ suit

and somewhere between 9 and 16 points.

NORTH has 6 points. If SOUTH had actually OPENED 1♠, NORTH would be obligated to bid. But knowing that

the Overcall will not be made with more than 16 points, NORTH just passes.}

{SOUTH has an opening hand, 15 points and five ♠s. But EAST beat him to the punch,

so he overcalls 1♠.

NORTH has 11 points, and if SOUTH had opened she would make a Limit Raise to 3♠.

But when replying to an Overcall, the strength needs to be a little higher. In Deal 1 it was OK to

pass a 1♠ Overcall with 6 points, here it is correct to just raise to 2♠ with 11 points.

SOUTH actually has a strong Overcall so he bids 4♠.}

{This time SOUTH has just 10 points, nowhere near an opening hand. Still, when EAST opens

1

♥

SOUTH should Overcall 1♠. This shows a good ♠ suit

and somewhere between 9 and 16 points.

NORTH has 13 points. If SOUTH had actually OPENED 1♠, NORTH would insist on game. But SOUTH didn't

Open, she just Overcalled. So NORTH must be more cautious. He jumps to 3♠ and SOUTH shows her

minimum type hand by passing.}

{NORTH has 15 points, a singleton in the opponent's suit and 4-card support for any suit

partner might name. In other words, a perfect Takeout Double.

SOUTH needs to make a medium-strong bid to apprise NORTH of her 10 points. She jumps to 2♠.

NORTH's hand is now worth 17 points because of the singleton. Since he is quite happy with

♠s he bids 4♠.}

{NORTH has 14 points, a doubleton in the opponent's ♠ suit and at least three cards in

each of the other suits. This is a normal Takeout Double.

SOUTH has a really awful hand. He has just one point and his only 4-card suit is the one the

opponents have already bid. He wants nothing more than to pass.

But he cannot pass. Partner's Double said "Bid your best suit.", so he bids 2♣.

Mercifully NORTH also passes.}
