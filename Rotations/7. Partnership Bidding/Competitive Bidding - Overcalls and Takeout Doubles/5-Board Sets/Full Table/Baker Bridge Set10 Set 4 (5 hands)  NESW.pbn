{There is only one reason that NORTH should not overcall with 1♠. He is too strong.

The maximum strength of an overcall is 16 points. Above that you should double.

So NORTH doubles, and after SOUTH bids 2♣, NORTH bids 2♠. This shows an overcall

type hand, but with 17 or more points.

SOUTH has fine trump support and 8 points so she bids a confident 4♠.}

WEST can make a Takeout Double, so he does.

EAST now cue-bids

to show opening hand strength.

WEST shows his

suit, EAST doesn't like it.

EAST shows her ♠ suit, WEST doesn't like it.

WEST shows his ♣ suit, EAST likes it fine, but decides 3NT will be easier than 5♣.}

{WEST would have had a great opening 1♠ bid. But when SOUTH opened 1♠

in front of him he was hornswaggled. He couldn't bid any other suit, he couldn't bid 1NT

and he sure couldn't bid ♠s. So he must pass.

And so does everybody else pass.}

{If South had passed, WEST would have opened with a preemptive 3♠.

She should make the same bid with the same hand AFTER the opponents open. And she makes it

for the same reason, to describe her hand and to take away bidding space from the opponents.

EAST treats it just like a Preemptive 3-bid, even though it is now called a Weak Jump Overcall.

In this case, EAST passes.}

{NORTH has 12 points, but with two 5-card suits worthy of an overcall. There isn't really a

right and wrong here, but it usually works out best to overcall in the higher-ranking suit. That

leaves open the possibility of bidding the second suit later.

In this Deal, after NORTH overcalls 1♠, that later possibility never happens because

everybody should pass.}
