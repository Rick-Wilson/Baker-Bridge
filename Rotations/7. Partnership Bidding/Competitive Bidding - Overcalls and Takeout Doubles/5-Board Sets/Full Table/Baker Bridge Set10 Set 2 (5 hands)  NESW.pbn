{With 14 points, ♣ shortage, and support for the other suits SOUTH makes a Takeout Double.

NORTH has 13 points so she bids 2♣. This is an artificial bid, apprising SOUTH of NORTH's opening

hand strength, and forcing the partnership to reach the game level.

SOUTH sugggests

s as trumps.

NORTH doesn't like

s so she suggests ♠s.

SOUTH agrees with ♠s and bids game, 4♠.}

opening is passed around to EAST. He is

tempted to overcall 1♠, but with 18 points is a little strong for a mere overcall.

Instead, he doubles.

With 8 points WEST is not strong enough to jump. She bids 2♣.

EAST now bids 2♠. By doubling first, then bidding his own suit,

he shows a good suit and 17+ points.

WEST raises to 4♠.}

{SOUTH has 18 points, a balanced hand, and a good stopper in their suit. He should overcall 1NT.

For 1NT overcalls, the range is increased to 15-18 points.

NORTH bids 2♣ (Stayman), just as she would with a 1NT opening. When SOUTH denies holding

a 4-card Major NORTH has enough points to bid 3NT. She doesn't worry about a ♠ stopper

since SOUTH promised he had the suit controlled.}

stoppers and a balanced hand.

She is two points too strong to overcall 1NT. Instead, she doubles.

EAST has an awful hand - but since he is forced to bid he says 1♠, assuming WEST wants

to hear his best suit.

WEST now bids 1NT, showing the balanced 19-21 point hand. EAST passes, of course.}

He plans to double, then bid NT. (see Deal 9)

SOUTH has 10 points though, so he jumps to 2♠.

In theory NORTH could now bid 2NT to continue the description of his hand, but he might as well

go ahead and bid 3NT instead.}
