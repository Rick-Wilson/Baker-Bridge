the punch by opening 1

But NORTH should get into the bidding anyway, by Overcalling 1♠. This shows a good ♠ suit

and somewhere between 9 and 16 points.

SOUTH has 6 points. If NORTH had actually OPENED 1♠, SOUTH would be obligated to bid. But knowing that

the Overcall will not be made with more than 16 points, SOUTH just passes.}

WEST has 11 points, and if EAST had opened she would make a Limit Raise to 3♠.

But when replying to an Overcall, the strength needs to be a little higher. In Deal 1 it was OK to

pass a 1♠ Overcall with 6 points, here it is correct to just raise to 2♠ with 11 points.

EAST actually has a strong Overcall so he bids 4♠.}

{SOUTH has a normal overcall of 1♠.

NORTH has a really good hand, but he doesn't have to worry about missing a slam since SOUTH will

not have more than 16 points. So he just bids what he thinks SOUTH can make, 4♠.}
