{SOUTH has 18 points, a doubleton in the opponent's suit, and at least three cards in the unbid suits.

This is an ideal hand for a Takeout Double.

NORTH has good strength in EAST's

suit, probably two stoppers.

He has 9 points and no 4-card suit of his own. This is the type of hand to respond 1NT.

SOUTH is happy to play Notrump now that she knows the

s are covered,

so she bids 3NT.}

{WEST has an opening hand, 14 points and five ♠s. But SOUTH beat him to the punch,

so he overcalls 1♠.

EAST also has 14 points, she doesn't care too much for ♠s, but she has an

excellent stopper in

s.

She jumps to 2NT, inviting WEST to bid game.

Since WEST has several points more than he might have had, and no 6-card ♠ suit to rebid,

he happily bids 3NT.}

{SOUTH has 15 points and all the requirements for a Takeout Double of 1♠.

With 14 points of his own, NORTH knows his side needs to be in a game somewhere. He passes this information

to SOUTH with a cue-bid of 2♠.

SOUTH gets the message and starts the hunt for a trump fit by bidding 3

makes it easy for NORTH - he bids 4

[Result ""]
{There is only one reason that WEST should not overcall with 1♠. He is too strong.

The maximum strength of an overcall is 16 points. Above that you should double.

So WEST doubles, and after EAST bids 2♣, WEST bids 2♠. This shows an overcall

type hand, but with 17 or more points.

EAST has fine trump support and 8 points so she bids a confident 4♠.}
