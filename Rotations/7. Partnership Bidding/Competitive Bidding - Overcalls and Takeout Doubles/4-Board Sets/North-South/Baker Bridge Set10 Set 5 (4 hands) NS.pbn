SOUTH can make a Takeout Double, so he does.

NORTH now cue-bids

to show opening hand strength.

SOUTH shows his

suit, NORTH doesn't like it.

NORTH shows her ♠ suit, SOUTH doesn't like it.

SOUTH shows his ♣ suit, NORTH likes it fine, but decides 3NT will be easier than 5♣.}

{WEST would have had a great opening 1♠ bid. But when SOUTH opened 1♠

in front of him he was hornswaggled. He couldn't bid any other suit, he couldn't bid 1NT

and he sure couldn't bid ♠s. So he must pass.

And so does everybody else pass.}

{If West had passed, NORTH would have opened with a preemptive 3♠.

She should make the same bid with the same hand AFTER the opponents open. And she makes it

for the same reason, to describe her hand and to take away bidding space from the opponents.

SOUTH treats it just like a Preemptive 3-bid, even though it is now called a Weak Jump Overcall.

In this case, SOUTH passes.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has 12 points, but with two 5-card suits worthy of an overcall. There isn't really a

right and wrong here, but it usually works out best to overcall in the higher-ranking suit. That

leaves open the possibility of bidding the second suit later.

In this Deal, after SOUTH overcalls 1♠, that later possibility never happens because

everybody should pass.}
