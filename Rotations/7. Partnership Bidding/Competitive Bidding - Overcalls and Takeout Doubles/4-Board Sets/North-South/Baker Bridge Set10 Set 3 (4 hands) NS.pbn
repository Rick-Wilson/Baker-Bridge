She is two points too strong to overcall 1NT. Instead, she doubles.

SOUTH has an awful hand - but since he is forced to bid he says 1♠, assuming NORTH wants

to hear his best suit.

NORTH now bids 1NT, showing the balanced 19-21 point hand. SOUTH passes, of course.}

He plans to double, then bid NT. (see Deal 9)

NORTH has 10 points though, so he jumps to 2♠.

In theory SOUTH could now bid 2NT to continue the description of his hand, but he might as well

go ahead and bid 3NT instead.}

{With a 5-card ♠ suit and 13 points NORTH should overcall 1♠.

SOUTH has 13 points and four ♠s. If NORTH had opened, SOUTH's hand would be good enough

to insist on game. But since NORTH overcalled, SOUTH merely invites with a jump to 3♠.

NORTH has better than a minimum overcall so she accepts the invitation and bids 4♠.}
