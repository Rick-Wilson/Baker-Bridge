opening is passed around to NORTH. He is

tempted to overcall 1♠, but with 18 points is a little strong for a mere overcall.

Instead, he doubles.

With 8 points SOUTH is not strong enough to jump. She bids 2♣.

NORTH now bids 2♠. By doubling first, then bidding his own suit,

he shows a good suit and 17+ points.

SOUTH raises to 4♠.}

{EAST has 18 points, a balanced hand, and a good stopper in their suit. He should overcall 1NT.

For 1NT overcalls, the range is increased to 15-18 points.

WEST bids 2♣ (Stayman), just as she would with a 1NT opening. When EAST denies holding

a 4-card Major WEST has enough points to bid 3NT. She doesn't worry about a ♠ stopper

since EAST promised he had the suit controlled.}

She is two points too strong to overcall 1NT. Instead, she doubles.

NORTH has an awful hand - but since he is forced to bid he says 1♠, assuming SOUTH wants

to hear his best suit.

SOUTH now bids 1NT, showing the balanced 19-21 point hand. NORTH passes, of course.}

He plans to double, then bid NT. (see Deal 9)

EAST has 10 points though, so he jumps to 2♠.

In theory WEST could now bid 2NT to continue the description of his hand, but he might as well

go ahead and bid 3NT instead.}

{With a 5-card ♠ suit and 13 points NORTH should overcall 1♠.

SOUTH has 13 points and four ♠s. If NORTH had opened, SOUTH's hand would be good enough

to insist on game. But since NORTH overcalled, SOUTH merely invites with a jump to 3♠.

NORTH has better than a minimum overcall so she accepts the invitation and bids 4♠.}
