{If West had passed, NORTH would have opened with a preemptive 3♠.

She should make the same bid with the same hand AFTER the opponents open. And she makes it

for the same reason, to describe her hand and to take away bidding space from the opponents.

SOUTH treats it just like a Preemptive 3-bid, even though it is now called a Weak Jump Overcall.

In this case, SOUTH passes.}

{EAST has 12 points, but with two 5-card suits worthy of an overcall. There isn't really a

right and wrong here, but it usually works out best to overcall in the higher-ranking suit. That

leaves open the possibility of bidding the second suit later.

In this Deal, after EAST overcalls 1♠, that later possibility never happens because

everybody should pass.}

She cannot bid 1NT without 2 more points.

She cannot overcall 2♣ with a terrible suit like that.

And EAST of course must also pass.}

{NORTH obviously has to pass when WEST opens 1♠.

SOUTH has a reasonable Takeout Double. She hopes NORTH will name a suit and they can just

play a partscore.

You should almost always bid when partner makes a Takeout Double. Almost always. This is the one time

when you don't. NORTH's ♠ are so good that he passes, converting the Takeout Double into a

Penalty Double.}

{NORTH has a normal overcall of 1♠.

SOUTH has a really good hand, but he doesn't have to worry about missing a slam since NORTH will

not have more than 16 points. So he just bids what he thinks NORTH can make, 4♠.}
