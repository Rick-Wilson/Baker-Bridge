{NORTH bids 3♠ to show a strong hand with a singleton ♠.

After SOUTH shows her first-round ♣ control NORTH decides he will bid slam if SOUTH has three Aces.

When Blackwood reveals just two Aces in SOUTH, NORTH stops at 5

{SOUTH bids 4♣ after NORTH's Jacoby 2NT. The reason for this bid is just to describe

her hand as having a side 5-card ♣ suit. SOUTH knows the eventual contract will

be some level of

NORTH doesn't have a strong hand, but he would show

control at

this time if he had the Ace. He isn't strong enough to go past game to show the ♠A, so he

just bids 4

{SOUTH should not be tempted to use Jacoby 2NT with this hand. There are only 12 points, and

the Limit Raise is a perfect way to show a 12 point support hand.

NORTH has more than enough strength to bid game after SOUTH's limit raise. If SOUTH had

mistakenly used a Jacoby 2NT response, NORTH would probably have tried to reach slam,

and perhaps gotten too high.}
