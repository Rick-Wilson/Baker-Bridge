{NORTH's 3

rebid shows better than average strength and six trumps.

Just what SOUTH was hoping for. She bids Blackwood - her plan is to bid 7

if NORTH has three Aces, bid 6

♥

if he has two Aces,

and stop at 5

♥

if he has just one. If North has no Aces SOUTH will get a new partner.}

{SOUTH indicates an above normal opening with five ♠s by her 3NT rebid.

NORTH also has some extra strength so he makes a Control showing bid of 4

Despite both partners showing extra strength South merely signs of at 4♠. Why? Because NORTH's

Control bid of 4

denied first-round control in both ♣s and

s. SOUTH realized she was off two Aces.}

{NORTH has a minimum opening hand with no extra features to brag about.

So after SOUTH's Jacoby 2NT bid he merely signs off at 4♠.

SOUTH would have cooperated if NORTH had made a slam try, but she doesn't have enough

to initiate the investigation herself.}

He promises 13+ points, at least four

SOUTH is obviously forced to game, but she is not thrilled to hear about NORTH's ♣ shortness. In fact,

it does nothing to help the value of her hand. So she bids the

{NORTH bids 3♠ to show the 6-card suit plus some extra strength.

SOUTH's failure to make a Control bid in either ♣s,

s, means just one thing -

She doesn't have any controls.

So NORTH settles for game.}
