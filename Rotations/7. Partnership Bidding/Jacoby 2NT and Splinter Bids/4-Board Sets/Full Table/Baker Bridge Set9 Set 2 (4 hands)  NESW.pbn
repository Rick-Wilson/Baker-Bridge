After NORTH bids 3♣ to show shortage, SOUTH makes a Control-showing bid

NORTH no longer worries about losing two quick

s. He uses

Blackwood to check for Aces, then bids 6♠.}

{EAST's 3

♥

rebid shows better than average strength and six trumps.

Just what WEST was hoping for. She bids Blackwood - her plan is to bid 7

♥

if EAST has three Aces, bid 6

♥

if he has two Aces,

and stop at 5

♥

if he has just one. If East has no Aces WEST will get a new partner.}

{SOUTH indicates an above normal opening with five ♠s by her 3NT rebid.

NORTH also has some extra strength so he makes a Control showing bid of 4

.

Despite both partners showing extra strength South merely signs of at 4♠. Why? Because NORTH's

Control bid of 4

denied first-round control in both ♣s and

s. SOUTH realized she was off two Aces.}

{WEST has a minimum opening hand with no extra features to brag about.

So after EAST's Jacoby 2NT bid he merely signs off at 4♠.

EAST would have cooperated if WEST had made a slam try, but she doesn't have enough

to initiate the investigation herself.}
