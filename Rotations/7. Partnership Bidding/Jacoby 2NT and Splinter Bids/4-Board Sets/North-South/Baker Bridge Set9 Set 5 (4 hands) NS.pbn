{NORTH bids 4♣ after SOUTH's Jacoby 2NT. The reason for this bid is just to describe

her hand as having a side 5-card ♣ suit. NORTH knows the eventual contract will

be some level of

SOUTH doesn't have a strong hand, but he would show

control at

this time if he had the Ace. He isn't strong enough to go past game to show the ♠A, so he

just bids 4

{NORTH should not be tempted to use Jacoby 2NT with this hand. There are only 12 points, and

the Limit Raise is a perfect way to show a 12 point support hand.

SOUTH has more than enough strength to bid game after NORTH's limit raise. If NORTH had

mistakenly used a Jacoby 2NT response, SOUTH would probably have tried to reach slam,

and perhaps gotten too high.}

A final check with Blackwood shows two Aces missing. Too bad.}
