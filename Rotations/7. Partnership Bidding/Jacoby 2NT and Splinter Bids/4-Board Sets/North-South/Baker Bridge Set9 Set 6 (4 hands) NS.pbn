{NORTH might just use Jacoby 2NT since he has great

support and

more than 13 points. But, he has so much more than 13 points that he should inform partner by

making a jump-shift. He plans to return to

s later.

SOUTH has different plans. Knowing partner has five ♠s and 17 or more points she pushes

straight to the ♠ slam.

It didn't matter, slam is cold in either Major.}

support, 13+ points and a singleton

NORTH first shows her

A, then, when SOUTH signs off,

makes one more try by showing her ♠A.

SOUTH finally gets inspired and bids the slam.}

{NORTH has a very minimum 2NT bid, but when SOUTH shows ♣ shortness she can Control-bid

her

A without showing extra values.

SOUTH's hand became huge when he heard about NORTH's

A.

When Blackwood shows they hold three Aces he bids what he expects to be a comfortable slam.}
