{NORTH has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1♠.

SOUTH has excellent ♠ support but with 11 points is not quite strong enough to insist

on reaching game. Instead he makes an invitational jump to 3♠, which NORTH is strong

enough to raise to game.}

SOUTH must respond with 8 points, but cannot bid either minor suit since he needs at least

SOUTH's response is based on simple math. He adds his 18 points to the 15 minimum that NORTH has announced and

comes up with 33 points combined. This is enough for a small slam, and since he has balanced distribution

he bids 6NT.}
