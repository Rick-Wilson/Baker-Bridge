{NORTH has a minimum 1♠ opening bid - 13 points and five trumps. She doesn't even suspect

what's about to befall!

SOUTH hears the 1♠ bid and all he wants to know is whether NORTH has one, two or three Aces.

So he uses the Blackwood convention, 4NT.

NORTH has two Aces so she bids 5

♥

(5♣ would show zero Aces,

5

♦

would show one Ace, etc).

SOUTH has heard enough and bids 6♠.}

{EAST has an above-minimum strength hand with a good 6-card suit. He opens 1

WEST, with 9 points, is a little too weak to bid at the 2-level so she bids a catchall 1NT.

EAST shows his 6-card suit and extra strength by jumping to 3

♥

, which

WEST raises to 4

since two trumps is now adequate support.}

{SOUTH has 14 points and opens her 4-card ♣ suit.

NORTH must respond, and with two 4-card Majors bids them "up-the-line", saying 1

.

SOUTH now shows his 4-card ♠ suit, and NORTH again must bid. Since NORTH is pretty weak he just

raises to 2♠, which SOUTH happily passes.}

{WEST has a maximum 17 point 1NT bid.

EAST, with 16 points, can't tell if there are enough points for slam. If WEST has

17 points then a slam should be makeable, but if WEST has only 15 points then he

should settle for game.

The 4NT raise solves the problem. It tells WEST to bid 6NT with 17 points, pass

with 15 points, and use best judgment with 16. Here WEST bids the slam.}

But when NORTH opens 1♠ SOUTH should show her "almost opening strength"

by jumping to 3♠.

NORTH has just 13 points, and knowing SOUTH has less than 13 he passes.}

{After EAST opens with 1

♥

, WEST has a small "dilemma".

With 11 points she really is only strong enough to make a jump raise to 3

♥

.

But, with five trumps the hand deserves more. So she just bids 4

♥

instead.

Usually, no matter what your strength, when you have five cards in the Major suit that your partner opens

with you should just jump right to game.}
