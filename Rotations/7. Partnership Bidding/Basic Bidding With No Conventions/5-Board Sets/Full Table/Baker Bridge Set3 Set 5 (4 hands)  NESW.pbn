{NORTH has a perfect 2NT opening hand, 20 points and 3-3-3-4 distribution.

SOUTH, with 12 points of his own, knows the partnership is borderline strong enough for slam.

Since he is happy with Notrump, he invites NORTH to bid slam by responding 4NT.

With one more point NORTH might bid the slam, but here she just passes.}

{EAST opens 1NT with 15 points and a balanced hand.

WEST, with 9 points, cannot bid game herself, but she can invite EAST to bid game if he

has the maximum 17 point opener. So she responds 2NT.

EAST doesn't have maximum, he has minimum, so he passes.}

{NORTH is 1 point too strong to open 1NT, so opens 1♣.

SOUTH responds in his 4-card Major suit,  1♠.

NORTH now shows her 4-card support plus her extra strength by jumping to 3♠ and SOUTH bids the game.}

{WEST has a classic 2NT opening bid, 21 points and balanced distribution.

EAST knows that her 7 points will be plenty for game, but not enough to consider

slam so she just bids 3NT.}
