{With balanced distribution and 16 points NORTH should open 1NT rather than 1

♦

.

SOUTH's response is based on simple math. He adds his 18 points to the 15 minimum that NORTH has announced and

comes up with 33 points combined. This is enough for a small slam, and since he has balanced distribution

he bids 6NT.}

{WEST is right at the maximum for a 1♠ opening bid - one more point and he would

have opened 2♣.

EAST does not have 3-card ♠ support but with 7 points must make some response.

She cannot bid at the 2-level so she says 1NT (6-10 points).

WEST is fine with Notrump so he bids 3NT.}

{SOUTH has a minimum 1♠ opening bid - 13 points and five trumps. She doesn't even suspect

what's about to befall!

NORTH hears the 1♠ bid and all he wants to know is whether SOUTH has one, two or three Aces.

So he uses the Blackwood convention, 4NT.

SOUTH has two Aces so she bids 5

♥

(5♣ would show zero Aces,

5

♦

would show one Ace, etc).

NORTH has heard enough and bids 6♠.}

{WEST has an above-minimum strength hand with a good 6-card suit. He opens 1

EAST, with 9 points, is a little too weak to bid at the 2-level so she bids a catchall 1NT.

WEST shows his 6-card suit and extra strength by jumping to 3

EAST raises to 4

{NORTH has 14 points and opens her 4-card ♣ suit.

SOUTH must respond, and with two 4-card Majors bids them "up-the-line", saying 1

NORTH now shows his 4-card ♠ suit, and SOUTH again must bid. Since SOUTH is pretty weak he just

raises to 2♠, which NORTH happily passes.}
