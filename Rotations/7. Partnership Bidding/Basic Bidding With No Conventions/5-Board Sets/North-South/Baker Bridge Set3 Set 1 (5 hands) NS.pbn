{SOUTH has an ideal 1NT opening -

15 points and balanced distribution.

With 12 points, NORTH knows the partnership total is between 27 and 29, enough for game

but not enough to think about slam. Since NORTH has no 4-card Major suit she bids 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{With 6 points, NORTH must respond to SOUTH's 1♣ opening bid.

While it is often correct to respond by bidding suits "up-the-line", NORTH should

skip over the weak

♦

suit in favor of showing the 4-card

Major ♠ suit.

SOUTH knows that NORTH may only have four ♠s, but with four of her own she can support the

suit. Since she has a minimum opening bid she merely raises to 2♠.

With his minimum response hand NORTH passes.}

{This is a classic Notrump bidding sequence.

NORTH opens 1NT with 17 points and balanced distribution.

SOUTH, with 9 points is not strong enough to bid game, but invites with 2NT.

NORTH has a maximum, so she accepts the invitation.}
