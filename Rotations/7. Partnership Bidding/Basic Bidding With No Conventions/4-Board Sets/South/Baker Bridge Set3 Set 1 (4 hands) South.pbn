{SOUTH has an ideal 1NT opening -

15 points and balanced distribution.

With 12 points, NORTH knows the partnership total is between 27 and 29, enough for game

but not enough to think about slam. Since NORTH has no 4-card Major suit she bids 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{With 6 points, SOUTH must respond to NORTH's 1♣ opening bid.

While it is often correct to respond by bidding suits "up-the-line", SOUTH should

skip over the weak

♦

suit in favor of showing the 4-card

Major ♠ suit.

NORTH knows that SOUTH may only have four ♠s, but with four of her own she can support the

suit. Since she has a minimum opening bid she merely raises to 2♠.

With his minimum response hand SOUTH passes.}

NORTH, however, doesn't have anything extra, so declines to go further.}
