{SOUTH has just 11 points, not enough to open the bidding.

But when NORTH opens 1♠ SOUTH should show her "almost opening strength"

by jumping to 3♠.

NORTH has just 13 points, and knowing SOUTH has less than 13 he passes.}

{After SOUTH opens with 1

♥

, NORTH has a small "dilemma".

With 11 points she really is only strong enough to make a jump raise to 3

♥

.

But, with five trumps the hand deserves more. So she just bids 4

♥

instead.

Usually, no matter what your strength, when you have five cards in the Major suit that your partner opens

with you should just jump right to game.}

{SOUTH has 19 points, but no 5-card Major suit. With two 4-card minor suits she should start

with 1

♦

.

NORTH has a poor hand, but with 7 points he must respond. His first priority is to show a Major suit

so he responds 1♠.

SOUTH now knows that ♠s will be trumps, so she revalues her hand to 21 points, enough for game.

She bids 4♠.}

{NOTE: There is a better way to bid this hand using special conventions.

SOUTH has 17 points, but with a 5-card Major opens 1♠ rather than 1NT.

NORTH isn't quite strong enough for a jump raise, so she bids 2♠.

SOUTH has enough extra to make a try for game, so she invites with 3♠.

NORTH has enough extra to accept the invitation, bids 4♠.}
