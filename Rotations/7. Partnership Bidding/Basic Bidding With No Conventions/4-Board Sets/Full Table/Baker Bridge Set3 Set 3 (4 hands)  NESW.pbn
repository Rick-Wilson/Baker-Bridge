opening, 14 points and five trumps.

NORTH must respond with 8 points, but cannot bid either minor suit since he needs at least

11 points to bid a new suit at the 2-level. So he bids 1NT (6-10 points).

SOUTH doesn't object to Notrump so she passes.}

WEST has good 4-card support and 7 points, so she raises to 2♠,

passed by EAST.

WEST does not consider showing the

{With balanced distribution and 16 points SOUTH should open 1NT rather than 1

.

NORTH's response is based on simple math. He adds his 18 points to the 15 minimum that SOUTH has announced and

comes up with 33 points combined. This is enough for a small slam, and since he has balanced distribution

he bids 6NT.}

{EAST is right at the maximum for a 1♠ opening bid - one more point and he would

have opened 2♣.

WEST does not have 3-card ♠ support but with 7 points must make some response.

She cannot bid at the 2-level so she says 1NT (6-10 points).

EAST is fine with Notrump so he bids 3NT.}
