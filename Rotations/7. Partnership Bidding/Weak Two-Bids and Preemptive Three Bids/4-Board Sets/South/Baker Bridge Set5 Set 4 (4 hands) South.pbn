{NORTH has one of those hands which might or might not be helpful to SOUTH. He needs

more information about SOUTH's hand, so he bids 2NT.

SOUTH has a better than average hand, so she bids 3♣ to show a high card in the suit.

NORTH was hoping for a high card in

he signs off in 3♠}

use 2NT to find out more about NORTH's hand.

SOUTH found out that NORTH has good opening strength, and, most importantly, either the

{SOUTH is strong enough to be thinking about game, depending on how good NORTH's hand is.

So he bids 2NT to get more information.

NORTH has the exact hand to say 3NT - a suit headed by AKQ.

Game (and bidding) doesn't get much easier.}
