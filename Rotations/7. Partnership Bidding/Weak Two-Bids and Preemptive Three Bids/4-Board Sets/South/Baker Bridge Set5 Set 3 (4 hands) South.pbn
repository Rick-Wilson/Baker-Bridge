Whether or not you play a new suit as a one round force or not, NORTH should make the 3♠ bid with

a hand this good. SOUTH then bids the ♠ game.}

{NORTH doesn't have much of a 3♣ opening bid.

But SOUTH has just the type of hand you need to bid 3NT after partner's preempt. The other three

suits well stopped, and certain entry in Opener's long suit. Notice here that 3NT is a good contract,

but 5♣ would go down 1.}
