{NORTH has a perfect hand for an opening bid of 2♠.

SOUTH will be tempted to respond with his opening hand and good trump support, but he should

resist the temptation. To raise a Weak Two-bid to game you should have quick winners, not just points.}

{EAST has the same hand as in Deal 1 and again opens 2♠.

This is the type of hand WEST needs to bid game. Notice that even with all those winners the

pair is nowhere close to having a slam. The will probably make just ten tricks.}

{Once more, SOUTH has the same hand as Deals 1 and 2.

This time NORTH has a very poor hand without any chance of making game. However, he should bid

4♠ anyway.

It is very likely that the opponents can make 4

if East gets the

opportunity to get into the bidding. Hopefully the 4♠ bid will shut him out, and 4♠ probably

won't go down more than a couple of tricks.}

bid.

EAST has the equivalent of an opening 1NT bid and will be very tempted to bid 3NT.

That might turn out to be a disaster, particularly if EAST is unable to reach the WEST hand.

EAST should assume WEST can win six tricks if

s are trumps. Thinking this way points EAST to her

best call - PASS.}

that is just enough for game. He bids 4

{EAST has a 7-card ♠ suit but he is too strong to open with a preemptive bid.

So he opens 1♠ instead.

WEST should respond 2♣, and EAST can do nothing but rebid the ♠ suit.

WEST thinks there should be game and bids 4♠}
