Wow! SOUTH has 21 HCP and two good

Nope, no slam here. Suppose NORTH has six

s headed by the AK. The trump suit

would certainly be solid, but then NORTH couldn't possibly have an outside Ace as well or he would have been

too strong for a Weak-two opening. So SOUTH just bids 4

But there's no sense bidding and probably making matters worse, so she grits her

teeth and passes.

{SOUTH doesn't have much of a 3♣ opening bid.

But NORTH has just the type of hand you need to bid 3NT after partner's preempt. The other three

suits well stopped, and certain entry in Opener's long suit. Notice here that 3NT is a good contract,

but 5♣ would go down 1.}
