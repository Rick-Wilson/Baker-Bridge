{The 2NT response to a Weak Two opening is a wonderful tool. You can learn a lot about

partner's hand and you are absolutely certain that it will not be passed out.

In this Deal NORTH has a huge hand and SOUTH opens 2

There are a lot of approaches NORTH might try, but the simplest is to start with 2NT.

When SOUTH shows

A K Q x x x NORTH has an easy 6NT bid.}

{SOUTH is unsure whether to bid game or not, so he bids 2NT to get more information about

NORTH's hand.

NORTH's 3♠ is discouraging, a hand below average in strength and no outside high card.

SOUTH passes and hopes for the best.}

{Most good players have an extra restriction in their Weak Two-bid guidelines - they won't

open with a Weak Two-bid when they hold an outside 4-card Major, even if the hand qualifies

otherwise. This Deal shows why.

If SOUTH opened with 2♠, NORTH might well pass and a
