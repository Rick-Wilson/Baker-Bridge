{SOUTH doesn't have much of a 3♣ opening bid.

But NORTH has just the type of hand you need to bid 3NT after partner's preempt. The other three

suits well stopped, and certain entry in Opener's long suit. Notice here that 3NT is a good contract,

but 5♣ would go down 1.}

more information about NORTH's hand, so he bids 2NT.

he signs off in 3♠}
