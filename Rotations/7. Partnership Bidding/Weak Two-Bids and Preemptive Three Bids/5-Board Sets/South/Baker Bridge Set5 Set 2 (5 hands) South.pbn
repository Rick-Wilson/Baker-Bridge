{SOUTH has a 7-card ♠ suit but he is too strong to open with a preemptive bid.

So he opens 1♠ instead.

NORTH should respond 2♣, and SOUTH can do nothing but rebid the ♠ suit.

NORTH thinks there should be game and bids 4♠}

Nope, no slam here. Suppose SOUTH has six

s headed by the AK. The trump suit

would certainly be solid, but then SOUTH couldn't possibly have an outside Ace as well or he would have been

too strong for a Weak-two opening. So NORTH just bids 4

But there's no sense bidding and probably making matters worse, so she grits her

teeth and passes.

If you think 3NT has a chance you are delusional.}
