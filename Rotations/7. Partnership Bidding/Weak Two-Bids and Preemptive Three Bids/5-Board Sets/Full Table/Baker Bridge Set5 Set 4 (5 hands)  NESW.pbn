{EAST's hand has the look of a Weak Two-bid, but it is one point too strong. So she opens 1♠.

WEST naturally bids 2♣ and EAST rebids the ♠ suit.

WEST always knew there would be a game bid, so with an 8-card fit he bids 4♠}

{NORTH may have an opening hand, but it is just the wrong kind of hand to respond to

partner's preemptive bid. She doesn't have the immediate winners that SOUTH is likely

to need, but she is in good shape for defense should the opponents bid.

In other words, NORTH has the perfect hand with which to pass.}

{The 2NT response to a Weak Two opening is a wonderful tool. You can learn a lot about

partner's hand and you are absolutely certain that it will not be passed out.

In this Deal WEST has a huge hand and EAST opens 2

There are a lot of approaches WEST might try, but the simplest is to start with 2NT.
