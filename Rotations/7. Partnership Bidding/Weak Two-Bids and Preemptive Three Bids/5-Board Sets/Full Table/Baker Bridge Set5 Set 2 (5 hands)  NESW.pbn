{NORTH has a 7-card ♠ suit but he is too strong to open with a preemptive bid.

So he opens 1♠ instead.

SOUTH should respond 2♣, and NORTH can do nothing but rebid the ♠ suit.

SOUTH thinks there should be game and bids 4♠}

Wow! WEST has 21 HCP and two good

Nope, no slam here. Suppose EAST has six

s headed by the AK. The trump suit

would certainly be solid, but then EAST couldn't possibly have an outside Ace as well or he would have been

too strong for a Weak-two opening. So WEST just bids 4

But there's no sense bidding and probably making matters worse, so she grits her

teeth and passes.

If you think 3NT has a chance you are delusional.}

Whether or not you play a new suit as a one round force or not, EAST should make the 3♠ bid with

a hand this good. WEST then bids the ♠ game.}
