{EAST has 20 points, a pretty strong hand to open 1

WEST has 12 points, and makes a Limit Raise, a jump to 3

EAST is very, very close to bidding a slam. But she knows WEST has 12 points at most, so she should

take the safe position and just bid 4

{NORTH passes to start with since he only has 9 points.

SOUTH naturally opens 1♠ with her 13 point, 5-card ♠ suit hand.

NORTH might now make a Limit Raise since his hand is now worth 11 points because of the

two doubletons. However, with six trumps he should jump all the way to 4♠.}

{WEST has 20 points, counting two extra for the fifth and sixth ♠s.

Naturally she opens 1♠.

EAST has a poor hand, but with 7 points he must respond. He has four of partner's ♠s

so he responds 2♠.

WEST

KNOWS

that 6 + 20 = 26, so she

GOES

to 4♠.}
