{SOUTH has a terrible hand, and naturally passes.

NORTH, however, has a nice 18 points and opens 1♠.

SOUTH still has a terrible hand, and passes again. You need at least 6 points to respond to

an opening one bid.}

{SOUTH has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1♠.

NORTH has good ♠ support and 10 points, counting 1 for the doubleton ♣.

It is easily worth a raise to 2♠

SOUTH cannot bid game yet, after all, NORTH could have as few as 6 points. But she can

continue with a 3♠ bid in hopes that NORTH actually has 9 or 10 points.

NORTH comes through with 4♠.}

A Limit Raise is an invitational bid, but SOUTH can add and he knows the total points will

be either 24 or 25. So he passes 3

{NORTH has a normal 1♠ opening bid, 14 points and five trumps.

SOUTH has good 4-card support and 7 points, so she raises to 2♠.

NORTH passes, knowing he is not missing a game contract. SOUTH can have a maximum of 10 points, which would

only reach 24 points when added to his 14.}
