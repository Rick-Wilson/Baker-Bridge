{NORTH has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1♠.

SOUTH has good ♠ support and 10 points, counting 1 for the doubleton ♣.

It is easily worth a raise to 2♠

NORTH cannot bid game yet, after all, SOUTH could have as few as 6 points. But she can

continue with a 3♠ bid in hopes that SOUTH actually has 9 or 10 points.

SOUTH comes through with 4♠.}

NORTH, with 4-card trump support, jumps to 3

A Limit Raise is an invitational bid, but SOUTH can add and he knows the total points will

be either 24 or 25. So he passes 3

{WEST has a normal 1♠ opening bid, 14 points and five trumps.

EAST has good 4-card support and 7 points, so she raises to 2♠.

WEST passes, knowing he is not missing a game contract. EAST can have a maximum of 10 points, which would

only reach 24 points when added to his 14.}

SOUTH has 11 points and four ♠s. So even though he has a balanced hand,

he jumps to 3♠, a Limit Raise.

NORTH adds: her 16 plus SOUTH's 11/12 equals a game, 4♠.}

{EAST has the type of 5-card Major hand that many players would open 1NT.

He has 17 points with most of them OUTSIDE the Major suit. But, many others

would disagree so for this Deal EAST will open 1♠.

WEST has 11 points and excellent (is that strong enough?) ♠ support.

So she naturally makes a Limit Raise of 3♠.

EAST adds the points and ignores the fact that his ♠ suit is Jack high.

He bids 4♠.}
