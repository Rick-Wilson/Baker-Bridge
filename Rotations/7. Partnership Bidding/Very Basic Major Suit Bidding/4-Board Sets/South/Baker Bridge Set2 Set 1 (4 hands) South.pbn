{SOUTH has 17 points counting 1 extra for the fifth ♠. This is a middle-range hand with five ♠s.

So he opens 1♠.

NORTH only has 7 points, 6 in high cards and one more for the doubleton

♦

.

But she does have three ♠s, so she can respond 2♠.

Since SOUTH is middle-range, he makes one more try by bidding 3♠.

If NORTH had 9 or 10 points she would now bid 4♠ - but with 7 she passes.}

{With 8 points, NORTH is not strong enough to open the bidding.

SOUTH has 13 points, barely meeting the minimum for a 1-opening. Note that the fifth and

sixth ♠ each added 1 point to his count. He opens 1♠.

Although NORTH passed originally, she must respond to SOUTH's opening bid. Since she has

three ♠s she raises to 2♠.

In light of NORTH's weak response SOUTH passes.}
