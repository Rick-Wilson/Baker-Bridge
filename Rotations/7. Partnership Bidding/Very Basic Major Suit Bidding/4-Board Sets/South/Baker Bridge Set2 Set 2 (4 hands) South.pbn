SOUTH has a mid-range hand, good enough to invite NORTH to bid the game.

Too bad, but NORTH is too weak to accept any invitations.}

{NORTH has a terrible hand, and naturally passes.

SOUTH, however, has a nice 18 points and opens 1♠.

NORTH still has a terrible hand, and passes again. You need at least 6 points to respond to

an opening one bid.}

{SOUTH has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1♠.

NORTH has good ♠ support and 10 points, counting 1 for the doubleton ♣.

It is easily worth a raise to 2♠

SOUTH cannot bid game yet, after all, NORTH could have as few as 6 points. But she can

continue with a 3♠ bid in hopes that NORTH actually has 9 or 10 points.

NORTH comes through with 4♠.}
