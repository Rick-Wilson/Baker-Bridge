{SOUTH has 14 points so he opens one of his 5-card Major suit, 1♠.

NORTH has some good ♣s, but with four of partner's Major she doesn't bother bidding anything else.

Since she has 11 points she jumps to 3♠, a Limit Raise.

SOUTH is very close to passing. He now gets to add a point for his doubleton ♣ which takes

him up to 15 points. So he has enough to bid 4♠.}

She bids 4♠.}
