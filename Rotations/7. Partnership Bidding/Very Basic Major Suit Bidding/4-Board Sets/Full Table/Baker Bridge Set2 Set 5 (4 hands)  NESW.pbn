{NORTH has 20 points, a pretty strong hand to open 1

♥

.

SOUTH has 12 points, and makes a Limit Raise, a jump to 3

♥

NORTH is very, very close to bidding a slam. But she knows SOUTH has 12 points at most, so she should

take the safe position and just bid 4

{WEST passes to start with since he only has 9 points.

EAST naturally opens 1♠ with her 13 point, 5-card ♠ suit hand.

WEST might now make a Limit Raise since his hand is now worth 11 points because of the

two doubletons. However, with six trumps he should jump all the way to 4♠.}

{SOUTH has 20 points, counting two extra for the fifth and sixth ♠s.

Naturally she opens 1♠.

NORTH has a poor hand, but with 7 points he must respond. He has four of partner's ♠s

so he responds 2♠.

SOUTH

KNOWS

that 6 + 20 = 26, so she

GOES

to 4♠.}
