{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \SK, West played the \S7 and North the \S5.

What do you play to the second trick?

When you have made your choice  

You can see the \S6, \S5, \S4, \S3 and \S2. So the \S7 is West's lowest \S, he is doing his best to discourage you from leading the suit again.

North held up with \S A J x, hoping you would play the suit again and give him two tricks.

If you play the \DT West will win the \DA and return a \S, allowing you to drive out North's \SA while you still have the \CA for an entry.}

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \SK, North played the \S7 and East the \S8.

What do you play to the second trick?

When you have made your choice  

You cannot see the \S5. The most likely reason is that North has it, and his \S7 is an encouraging signal. The only reason he would encourage you is if he held either the \SA or \SJ.

Together, you two continue to play \Ss to drive out East's \SA. When you get the lead with your \CA you will cash your \S winners and North will still have the \DA for some icing on the cake.

There IS another possibility if East is a better than average Declarer. North just might hold \S 9 7, giving East \S A J 8 5. East played the \S8 as a falsecard to tempt you into playing the suit again. This isn't too likely, but if it happens just congratulate East for the fine play.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CA, dummy played the \C4 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

West will play the \CQ on which you will play the \C2.

West now knows you started with a doubleton, and more importantly, he also knows you want him to play a third \C.

When he next plays the \CK dummy will ruff, but whatever card he ruffs with you will have established a trump trick. When you later win your \SK that will be down 1.}

{You are North. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \D5, South wins the \DQ and returns the \D7. West holds up his \DA until the third round. He then plays the \CQ and it is your play. 

When you have made your choice  

You assume (hope) that South holds the \CA. If he does then he will need help from you to decide which trick he should win. You play the \C8 first, and the \C2 next to show an even number.

If South is paying attention he will know to win the THIRD \C. This will kill dummy's \C suit, and with it West's chance of making 9 tricks.}

{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CA, dummy played the \C2 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

If you signal with the \C9 East will continue with the \CK and another which you will have to ruff. You will give up your NATURAL trump trick by doing so. Worse, you will allow South's \CJ to be established as a winner that North can later discard a \D on. 

Much better to play low. Partner will surely switch to a \D, and North will probably finesse, though it doesn't matter whether he does or not. You will win the \DK, return the \C9 back to East's \CK, and still have your trump trick for later.}

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \SA, North plays the \S9, East the \S5. You assume North has signaled you to continue \Ss, so you play the \SQ. On this trick North plays the \S3 and East the \S8. How will you continue? 

When you have made your choice  

You might just switch suits, but you have a better choice.

If you play your \SQ, North won't bother ruffing, East WILL ruff and dummy's \SJ will be established as a winner.

The best procedure is to lead a low \S. North will ruff and East will over-ruff but by playing this way you stop the establishment of West's \SJ. As you can see, East would have been able to discard a loser on that \SJ if you hadn't played this way.}
