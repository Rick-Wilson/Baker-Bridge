{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \HQ, you played low and North won the \HA.

North now plays the \DJ on which East plays the \D2. What do you play now, and what is your plan.

When you have made your choice  

South hoped his \D suit would provide enough tricks to make the game. You can see that there is no entry to the South hand EXCEPT in \Ds, so you want to win your \DA on the trick that North plays his last \D. How can you tell which trick that is?

Only by watching what East plays. On the \DJ East played the \D2, a low card signaling that he held an ODD number of \Ds. ODD must be either one or three so when he followed to the next \D you know he started with three. A little bit of counting tells you that North started with the doubleton Jack, so you want to win the second \D trick.

This defense holds North to one \D tricks, if you had let him win the second one he would have had 9 tricks. }

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \H4, North plays the \HJ, won by East with \HA.

East plays the \SJ, you follow with \S5, dummy \S3 and North plays the \S2. East continues with the \ST and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

North's \S2 tells you he had an ODD number of \Ss, obviously 3. Since East also must have 3, you must take your \SA on the third round, depriving dummy of the extra \S trick.

East may now turn to the \D suit, but your side can win the first \D and drive out East's \HK. You will win 2 \Hs, 2 \Ds and the \SA, down 1}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \H5, dummy played the \HT and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

You really want West to lead a \C if he gets into the lead. If you discard the \C9 West will surely get the message and will lead a \C. BUT - you will only win 3 \C tricks. The \C9 would have been the fourth winner.

So instead, play a low card in one of the other suits, say the \D3.

South is one trick short and he sees he can easily get that trick in \Hs. So he plays a second \H from dummy and you now discard the \S2. West takes the \HA and he can see that you don't want him to lead a \S or a \D. He deduces that you might like a \C so he plays his \C2 and you win 4 tricks.}

When you have made your choice  

Partner played the \H3, a low card, for you to ruff. That means his re-entry, if he has one, is in the lower-ranking suit.

Partner takes the \CA and gives you a second \H ruff.}

{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \DA, dummy played the \D3 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

You know partner also has the \DK, and normally you would give an encouraging signal when you hold the Queen. But with this hand you want partner to switch to \Cs as soon as possible. So you play a low \D.

East looks at your signal, then looks at dummy, then looks at your signal. He knows you want a switch and it looks like a switch to \Cs might work the best. North plays a low \C from dummy, you win the \CJ. Next you play a low \D, taken by East with his \DK. East leads a \C. Dummy plays the \CK, you win that, cash another \C, then cash your \DQ. That first signal led to your side winning the first 6 tricks. Wow.}

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \HA, North puts on the \HQ. It's your play. 

When you have made your choice  

North's \HQ is either a singleton, (practically impossible), or a signal showing that he also holds the \HJ. In either case you can reach the North hand on the second trick by playing a low \H. Since you don't particularly want to start playing \Ds from your side, you go ahead and play a small \H, won by North with the \HJ.

North next plays the \DQ and however East tries it your side will take the next two \D tricks and set the contract.}
