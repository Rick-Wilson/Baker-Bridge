{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \DA, dummy played the \D3 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

You know partner also has the \DK, and normally you would give an encouraging signal when you hold the Queen. But with this hand you want partner to switch to \Cs as soon as possible. So you play a low \D.

East looks at your signal, then looks at dummy, then looks at your signal. He knows you want a switch and it looks like a switch to \Cs might work the best. North plays a low \C from dummy, you win the \CJ. Next you play a low \D, taken by East with his \DK. East leads a \C. Dummy plays the \CK, you win that, cash another \C, then cash your \DQ. That first signal led to your side winning the first 6 tricks. Wow.}

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \HA, North puts on the \HQ. It's your play. 

When you have made your choice  

North's \HQ is either a singleton, (practically impossible), or a signal showing that he also holds the \HJ. In either case you can reach the North hand on the second trick by playing a low \H. Since you don't particularly want to start playing \Ds from your side, you go ahead and play a small \H, won by North with the \HJ.

North next plays the \DQ and however East tries it your side will take the next two \D tricks and set the contract.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. West led the \DA, dummy played the \D2 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

As soon as dummy appears you can see 3 tricks for your side. Partner surely has the \DK to go with his Ace and you have a certain trump trick. However, that's all you can see.

Your best hope is that West may be able to win a \S trick, and it may be important for the first \S lead to come from your side of the table.

Your \DQ play informs partner that you also have the \DJ, giving him the option of underleading his \DK to get to your hand.

West next plays a small \D which you win with your \DJ. You return the \ST. This establishes West's \SK before South can pull trumps and discard one of dummy's \Ss on his fourth \C.}

{You are North. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \S5, South plays the \ST and West wins the \SK. To the second trick West plays the \CT and you must discard something. 

When you have made your choice  

You know that South has no high \S honor or he would have played it to the first trick. So West has the \S A Q left, plus all those \C tricks. You need to have North switch to a \H if possible.

South must be expecting to lead a \S back when he wins the \CQ which you hope he holds. Your \SJ discard may make him rethink. If your \Ss were any good why would you be discarding a winner when all you had to do was toss a small red card?

Hopefully South will come to the conclusion that this is Suit Preference for a \H return and will play his \HJ. Hopefully.}

{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \SA, dummy played the \S2 and you signal with your \ST. East next plays the \SQ and you drop the \S4, completing your doubleton signal. East then plays the \SK and it turns out you don't have to ruff after all. So what are you going to play?

When you have made your choice  

This should be a clear enough signal for East to play a \C to your \CA next.

An alternate play, just as good, would be for you to ruff the good \SQ and play the \CA yourself.

If you don't get your \C trick at trick 4 you will never get it. North will discard his \CK on South's extra \D winner.}
