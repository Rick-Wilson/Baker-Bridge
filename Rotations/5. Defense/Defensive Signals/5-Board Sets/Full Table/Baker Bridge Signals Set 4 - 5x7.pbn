{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CK, dummy's singleton was played and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

East will look at your \C9 and perhaps think for an instant that you want him to play another \C.

But it will be a short instant because a look at dummy makes in absolutely clear to everybody that playing another \C could not help your side. Dummy has so many trumps that repeated \C leads would do nothing.

OK. If it's not an encouraging Attitude signal, what is it? Suit preference of course. Since it is a high spot card you are asking East to switch to the higher suit (choosing between \Ds and \Hs).

East dutifully plays a \H and you take the next three tricks. Had he switched to a \D instead, North would have been able to discard one of his \H losers on South's \DQ.}

{You are North. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CA. Seeing your \C3 he next played the \DA. What will you play on this trick?

When you have made your choice  

Normally with this holding you would play the \D9 to encourage South to play a second \D through dummy's \D Q T.

But this time you really want him to take his \CK. So play the discouraging \D2 and hope he gets the message to go back to \Cs. If he does play the \CK next it will win and he can then give you a \C ruff.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \H5, you put on the \HJ, South won with the \HA. The second trick was \DA, \D2, \D3, \D5. The third trick was \DJ, \D6, \D8, \D7. South then put the \CQ on the table.

When you have made your choice  

Does it look to you like South is trying to create an entry to dummy so he can cash the 2 \D winners? That's what he wants it to look like, hoping someone holds up their \CA.

But don't believe Declarer, believe your partner. On the first \D West played the \D2. On the second \D he played the \D6. He has an odd number of \Ds, obviously 3. And South must also have a third one, so he is up to some trickery with that \CQ.

So grab your \CA and return partner's \H suit. }

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown. The 2\H bid was a transfer. The 5NT bid meant to choose either 6\S or 6NT. West liked the suit. Partner led the \S5, won by West's \SQ. West pulls one more trump with his \SA, then wins three high \Ds. Next comes dummy's \HA on which he plays the \H3 and North plays the \H9. Then he leads dummy's \H6 which you win with the \HQ. On this trick West drops the \HJ and North the \H2. It is your play.

When you have made your choice  

If you believe West is now out of \Hs then you shoud not play your \HK because it would give him a ruff-sluff.

But you shouldn't believe West when your partner has sent you a clear signal that he holds an EVEN number of \Hs. In this case an even number must be 4 which means that West has one more \H. So you play your \HK. He ruffs in dummy of course, but then has no way to get rid of that \C loser when the finesse fails.

If you had not been paying attention to North's signal you might have decided to risk a \C lead - with a disastrous result.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \CA, West played the \C2 and North the \C9. What should you play to the second trick?

When you have made your choice  

On first thought West's \C2 seems to be a discouraging signal. Think again.

After the first trick you know the location of every \C except the \CQ and \CJ. If West started with \C J 2 he would have signaled with the \CJ. If West started with \C Q J 2 he would have signaled with the \CQ. Since he did neither he started either with singleton \C 2 or with \C Q 2. In either case you should play a low \C now which he will either win with his \CQ or he will ruff.

It turns out that he wins with the \CQ, then leads a \S back to your \S A Q.}
