{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CA, dummy played the \C2 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

If you signal with the \C9 East will continue with the \CK and another which you will have to ruff. You will give up your NATURAL trump trick by doing so. Worse, you will allow South's \CJ to be established as a winner that North can later discard a \D on. 

Much better to play low. Partner will surely switch to a \D, and North will probably finesse, though it doesn't matter whether he does or not. You will win the \DK, return the \C9 back to East's \CK, and still have your trump trick for later.}

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \SA, North plays the \S9, East the \S5. You assume North has signaled you to continue \Ss, so you play the \SQ. On this trick North plays the \S3 and East the \S8. How will you continue? 

When you have made your choice  

You might just switch suits, but you have a better choice.

If you play your \SQ, North won't bother ruffing, East WILL ruff and dummy's \SJ will be established as a winner.

The best procedure is to lead a low \S. North will ruff and East will over-ruff but by playing this way you stop the establishment of West's \SJ. As you can see, East would have been able to discard a loser on that \SJ if you hadn't played this way.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \HQ, you played low and South won the \HA.

South now plays the \DJ on which West plays the \D2. What do you play now, and what is your plan.

When you have made your choice  

North hoped his \D suit would provide enough tricks to make the game. You can see that there is no entry to the North hand EXCEPT in \Ds, so you want to win your \DA on the trick that South plays his last \D. How can you tell which trick that is?

Only by watching what West plays. On the \DJ West played the \D2, a low card signaling that he held an ODD number of \Ds. ODD must be either one or three so when he followed to the next \D you know he started with three. A little bit of counting tells you that South started with the doubleton Jack, so you want to win the second \D trick.

This defense holds South to one \D tricks, if you had let him win the second one he would have had 9 tricks. }

{You are North. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \H4, South plays the \HJ, won by West with \HA.

West plays the \SJ, you follow with \S5, dummy \S3 and South plays the \S2. West continues with the \ST and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

South's \S2 tells you he had an ODD number of \Ss, obviously 3. Since West also must have 3, you must take your \SA on the third round, depriving dummy of the extra \S trick.

West may now turn to the \D suit, but your side can win the first \D and drive out West's \HK. You will win 2 \Hs, 2 \Ds and the \SA, down 1}
