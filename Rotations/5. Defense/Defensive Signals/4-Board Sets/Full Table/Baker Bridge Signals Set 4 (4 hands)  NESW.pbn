{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. East led the \DA, dummy played the \D2 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

As soon as dummy appears you can see 3 tricks for your side. Partner surely has the \DK to go with his Ace and you have a certain trump trick. However, that's all you can see.

Your best hope is that East may be able to win a \S trick, and it may be important for the first \S lead to come from your side of the table.

Your \DQ play informs partner that you also have the \DJ, giving him the option of underleading his \DK to get to your hand.

East next plays a small \D which you win with your \DJ. You return the \ST. This establishes East's \SK before North can pull trumps and discard one of dummy's \Ss on his fourth \C.}

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \S5, North plays the \ST and East wins the \SK. To the second trick East plays the \CT and you must discard something. 

When you have made your choice  

You know that North has no high \S honor or he would have played it to the first trick. So East has the \S A Q left, plus all those \C tricks. You need to have South switch to a \H if possible.

North must be expecting to lead a \S back when he wins the \CQ which you hope he holds. Your \SJ discard may make him rethink. If your \Ss were any good why would you be discarding a winner when all you had to do was toss a small red card?

Hopefully North will come to the conclusion that this is Suit Preference for a \H return and will play his \HJ. Hopefully.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \SA, dummy played the \S2 and you signal with your \ST. West next plays the \SQ and you drop the \S4, completing your doubleton signal. West then plays the \SK and it turns out you don't have to ruff after all. So what are you going to play?

When you have made your choice  

This should be a clear enough signal for West to play a \C to your \CA next.

An alternate play, just as good, would be for you to ruff the good \SQ and play the \CA yourself.

If you don't get your \C trick at trick 4 you will never get it. South will discard his \CK on North's extra \D winner.}

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CK, dummy's singleton was played and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

North will look at your \C9 and perhaps think for an instant that you want him to play another \C.

But it will be a short instant because a look at dummy makes in absolutely clear to everybody that playing another \C could not help your side. Dummy has so many trumps that repeated \C leads would do nothing.

OK. If it's not an encouraging Attitude signal, what is it? Suit preference of course. Since it is a high spot card you are asking North to switch to the higher suit (choosing between \Ds and \Hs).

North dutifully plays a \H and you take the next three tricks. Had he switched to a \D instead, West would have been able to discard one of his \H losers on East's \DQ.}
