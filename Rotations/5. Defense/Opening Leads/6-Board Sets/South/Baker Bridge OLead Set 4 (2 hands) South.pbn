{The bidding has been as shown. The contract is 6NT and it is your lead.

When you have made your choice  

Admittedly the \HQ looks very tempting, but resist the temptation.

Since dummy bid \Hs, don't help declarer by leading the suit. Declarer has 11 tricks, and will hope to pick up one more in \Cs, but that won't happen.

But if you start with the \HQ, he will win with his \HK and can then establish an extra \H winner by leading through your \H J T into dummy's \H A 9.

With any lead other than a \H honor he cannot come to 12 tricks.}

{The bidding has been as shown. The contract is 4\S and it is your lead.

When you have made your choice  

Did you choose the \HQ? I was afraid you would. That is wrong, but because this is the last Deal I'm going to give you another chance.

Look at the bidding carefully, then ask yourself why you doubled.

Now pick the opening lead that will set the contract, then  

North/South apparently have 8 or more \Cs between them, which leaves partner with a singleton at most.

Partner will ruff the second \C, and when you get into the lead with the Ace of trumps you will play a third \C which he will again ruff.

That's why you doubled.}
