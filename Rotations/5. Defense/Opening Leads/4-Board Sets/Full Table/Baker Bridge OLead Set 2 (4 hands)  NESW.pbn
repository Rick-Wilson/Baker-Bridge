{The bidding has been as shown. The contract is 3NT and it is your lead.

When you have made your choice  

The top of a solid 3-card honor sequence is best, but as you can see, a broken 3-card sequence may work out just as good.

North will likely try the \C finesse, and when West wins the \CK he will return a \S through North's \ST.}

{The bidding has been as shown. The contract is 4\S and it is your lead.

When you have made your choice  

You have \D winners, but dummy will surely be short since he has at least 8 cards in the Major suits.

Partner has whatever \H strength your side possesses.

It is very likely that declarer will want to do some cross-trumping. To try to cut that down your best lead is a trump.

Just imagine that declarer wins the first \S in his hand and plays a \H to dummy's honors. North will win and play another trump. Whenever you win your first \D you will play your last trump.

As you can imagine, declarer will be in a whole lot of trouble.}

2NT pass 6NT pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. The contract is 6NT and it is your lead.

When you have made your choice  

You held this identical hand in Deal 3. The declarer was playing 3NT and the best lead was the \S4, fourth down.

It's different when the conract is 6NT. Against 6NT you should make a passive lead, which means don't underlead any honors. Against 6NT you have little chance of establishing a suit to win four or five tricks. Instead, you just want to try to not give declarer an undeserved trick.

So any passive lead would be OK, you pick the \H just because they are less likely to have an unbid 4-card Major in either hand.

Declarer has 11 winners sitting there; if you had led a low \S you would have handed him his 12 trick on a platter.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. The contract is 6\D and it is your lead.

When you have made your choice  

Against a notrump slam it is best to make a passive lead so you don't give declarer an undeserved winner.

Against a suit slam the situation is very different. Against strong dummy bidding like this you are pretty sure that if you don't establish a winner early declarer will find something in dummy to discard losers on. In this hand it is dummy's \C suit.

Your most promising suit is \Ss. Obviously partner has a very weak hand, but if he has the \SQ you can set up your \SK before your King of trumps is dislodged.

Without a \S lead declarer will have smooth sailing.}
