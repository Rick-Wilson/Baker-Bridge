{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \H8, dummy played the \HJ and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

South played dummy's \HJ to tempt you to cover. Don't fall for it.

Partner's lead of a high spot card shows no honors in the suit. That added to the fact that South bid Notrump after you had mentioned \Hs is pretty good evidence that South holds at least \H Q x x. 

To maintain communication with partner your best hope is to duck the first \H, but to signal encouragement with the \H9.

South wins the first trick easily, but must try to establish \Cs. He will enter dummy with the \SA, then try to run the \CQ.

Not today. Partner takes the \CK and returns his \H2 to your four winners.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \C9, dummy played the \CT and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

Partner's \C9 is likely from a short suit. If it is a singleton, you should take the \CA immediately and return the suit for a ruff. If it is a doubleton, you should NOT take your \CA now, but should hope partner can get the lead and play his second \C to your Ace so you can give him the ruff.

You can figure out which it is.

If it is a singleton, then South must hold 5 \Cs. But you know South has 4 \Ss, so if he also has 5 \Cs then he only has 4 red cards, and he would not have opened 1NT with either 5-4-2-2 or 5-4-3-1 distribution.

So partner's \C9 is not a singleton, and you should wait. Declarer then runs dummy's \SQ. Partner wins the \SK, returns his OTHER \C to your \CA, and NOW you give him the ruff. He takes the \DA for down 1.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \HT, dummy played the \HJ and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

Declarer gets two \H winners whether you play one of your honors on this trick or not. So why does it matter what you do?

Suppose you cover with your \HQ. South will win his \HA, then play \Cs until your \CA is forced out on the third round. He can then force an entry to dummy in the \H suit to reach the two \C winners.

Now suppose you duck the \HJ. Again South will push \Cs, and again you hold up until the third round. Ahh, what a difference. Now declarer cannot use the \Hs to enter dummy and he will never get to enjoy those two \C winners.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \SQ, a low card was played from dummy, and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

It seems that perhaps you should play low and let partner's \SQ force out South's \SA. Then, when you get the lead with a high \C you can force out South's \SJ. Get the lead with your other high \C and set the contract with \Ss.

Suppose you try that. Play low on the first \S. South will also play low and West will be left holding the trick, and also holding the bag!With no more \Ss West will have to play one of the other three suits, and that is just what South wants to have happen. The contract could no longer be beaten.

Now do it the right way. Play your \SK on partner's \SQ. Assume South takes the trick, although it doesn't matter whether he wins the first one or holds up. When you win your first \C drive out South's \SJ. When you win your second \C trick your \Ss will be good. If you overtake the first trick the contract can no longer be made.

Notice that South will always make two \S tricks, so your overtake costs nothing.}
