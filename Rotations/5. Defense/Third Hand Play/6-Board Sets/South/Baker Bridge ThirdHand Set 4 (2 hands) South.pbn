{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CK, dummy played the \C7 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

As soon as you see the opening lead and dummy you should start figuring out just how you can defeat the contract. Hopefully this plan came to your mind.

From his lead, you know partner also holds the \CQ. Overtake the \CK. Play your singleton \H5. When South starts on trumps, win the first one with your \SA. Put partner back on lead with a small \C to his known \CQ.

If you have a partner who pays attention he will now play a \H for you to ruff. Two \Cs, the Ace of trumps, and a \H ruff makes down 1.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \DK, dummy played low and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

Put yourself in partner's shoes. He almost surely has \D K Q T x (x). When South holds up on his \DA, which he almost surely will, West may think he is holding up with \D A J x, and be afraid to continue the suit.

You can help your partner figure out the true situation by merely playing your \DJ so he can see that South doesn't have it.

With this good play West will be able to continue \Ds and defeat the contract.}
