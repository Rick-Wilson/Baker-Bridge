{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \SQ, a low card was played from dummy, and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

It seems that perhaps you should play low and let partner's \SQ force out North's \SA. Then, when you get the lead with a high \C you can force out North's \SJ. Get the lead with your other high \C and set the contract with \Ss.

Suppose you try that. Play low on the first \S. North will also play low and East will be left holding the trick, and also holding the bag!With no more \Ss East will have to play one of the other three suits, and that is just what North wants to have happen. The contract could no longer be beaten.

Now do it the right way. Play your \SK on partner's \SQ. Assume North takes the trick, although it doesn't matter whether he wins the first one or holds up. When you win your first \C drive out North's \SJ. When you win your second \C trick your \Ss will be good. If you overtake the first trick the contract can no longer be made.

Notice that North will always make two \S tricks, so your overtake costs nothing.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \S9, dummy played the \S6 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

You could easily win the \SK, then play a small \S to drive out dummy's \SA. But East bid Notrump over your 2\S overcall, so he surely holds \S Q J T. So when you get the lead with your one \CA entry you can establish your \Ss, but you won't get into the lead to cash them.

Look what happens when you duck the first trick. East will win the trick with his \ST, and start on dummy's \C suit.

South (your wonderful partner) will win the first \C and return his final \S to dummy's \SA.

East will have to keep working on \Cs, but now you can win the \CA and play your \SK, dropping East's \SQ, and your other three good \Ss.

Just like the previous deal, East gets two \S tricks either way, but one way he makes an overtrick, the other way he goes down 2.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CK, dummy played low and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

You are pretty sure partner would not have supported your \Cs unless he had 4 of them, which means it is very likely that South has a singleton. (he might even be void)

So if you are to set this contract partner is going to have to have some \S winners. It might not matter, but it also might be vital that the first \S lead comes from your side of the table so after you overtake with the \CA you switch to the \S7.

Partner loves it - whatever South does West takes the next two \Ss, then leads a third \S for you to ruff. Down 1.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CK, dummy played the \C7 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

As soon as you see the opening lead and dummy you should start figuring out just how you can defeat the contract. Hopefully this plan came to your mind.

From his lead, you know partner also holds the \CQ. Overtake the \CK. Play your singleton \H5. When West starts on trumps, win the first one with your \SA. Put partner back on lead with a small \C to his known \CQ.

If you have a partner who pays attention he will now play a \H for you to ruff. Two \Cs, the Ace of trumps, and a \H ruff makes down 1.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \DK, dummy played low and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

Put yourself in partner's shoes. He almost surely has \D K Q T x (x). When North holds up on his \DA, which he almost surely will, East may think he is holding up with \D A J x, and be afraid to continue the suit.

You can help your partner figure out the true situation by merely playing your \DJ so he can see that North doesn't have it.

With this good play East will be able to continue \Ds and defeat the contract.}
