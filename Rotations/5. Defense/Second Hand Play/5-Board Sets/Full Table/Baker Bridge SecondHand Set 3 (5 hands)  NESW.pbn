{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \DQ, you signaled with the \D8 and North won the \DA.

North then played low to dummy's \SK, and led dummy's \S6. Your decision is not whether to play high or low, but whether to ruff or not, which amounts to the same thing.

When you have made your choice  

Even though North holds the \SA, if you ruff now he will just put on a small \S and you will be ruffing a loser. Instead discard a \D.

North will win the \SA, but will not be able to ruff any \S losers in dummy because your trumps can overruff any of South's trumps.

Suppose you had ruffed the \S. North would have played his \S9, leaving himself with \S A J. He would then get the lead and pull your two remaining trumps. That would leave one trump in dummy to ruff his \SJ, his only remaining loser.}

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown.

You lead the \CK and continue with the \CJ then \CQ, taken by East's \CA. To trick 4 East plays the \H4. What do you play?

When you have made your choice  

To see why you should play the \HQ, just visualize the result if you play low. East will finesse with dummy's \H8. If North wins his \HJ on this trick there will be 4 good \H tricks in dummy. If North withholds his \HJ then Declarer will have 3 \H winners.

Now visualize the result of playing the \HQ. Whether East takes this trick or not he cannot win more than 2 \Hs.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown.

Partner led the \HT, won by dummy's \HA. At trick 2 South calls for dummy's \C3. Which card do you play?

When you have made your choice  

You would not have been expecting South to play a small \C from dummy's holding. The only way it makes sense is if South holds the \CQ.

If you play your \CK you will win the trick, but in so doing you will set up 3 \C tricks for South, which is all he needs to make the slam.

Play low instead and South will win his \CQ. But now your \C K T sits behind dummy's \C J 4 so he can get only one more trick in the suit, the \CA. }

{You are North. The bidding has been as shown.

You lead the \SJ, the \SK is played from dummy and holds the trick. Next come dummy's \HK, then another trump to West's \HA.

At trick 4 West plays the \C2 from his hand and you must decide what to play.

When you have made your choice  

West has 2 small \Cs and faces a choice of dummy plays in the suit. He must decide whether to play you for the \CA or the \CQ. If you play your \CA you make the decision very easy for him.

When you correctly play your small \C life becomes harder for West. Sometimes he will guess correctly and play dummy's \CK, but other times he will play dummy's \CJ, hoping you have the \CQ.}

{You are West. The bidding has been as shown.

Partner led the \S6. You won the \SA and returned the \S9, won by North's \SQ.

North next played to dummy's \CA and led the \D2. What do you play?

When you have made your choice  

Count the points. North's 15-17 plus South's 11 plus your T comes to 36-38. So East has room for an Ace or a King, but no more.

East's second \S play was the 2, so it looks like he started with 5 \Ss. And the fall of North's \Ss looks like he may have 1 \S left, very likely the \SK.

All this means that you should take your \DA now and return your last \S to establish East's suit. Now East's \DK will be an entry to the \Ss

If you play low, East will have to take the \DK now, and although he can play a \S to establish the suit, he will not have an entry to be able to cash them.}
