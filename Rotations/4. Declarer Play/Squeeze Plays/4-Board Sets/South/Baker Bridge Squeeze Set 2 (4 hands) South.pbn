{South is to play 6NT. West leads the \HK.

For a squeeze to operate you will need to lose one trick and the time to do that is right now. Let West hold the \HK and win his \H continuation with your \HA. 

You might as well find out about the \Ss right now. Play the \S A K Q. 

Too bad, West discards a \H on the third round of \Ss.  

Play the \DA, then \D K Q. 

East will follow to all three \Ds.  

Play dummy's \DJ and discard your \HT.

If East discards the \SJ you will cash dummy's \S6, then win the last 3 \C tricks. 

So East will no doubt throw a \C instead. In which case you win the last 4 \C tricks.

Squeezes are so very satisfying.}

{South is to play 6\D. West leads the \HK.

At first things look hopeless, but remember this is a lesson on squeeze plays. From the opening lead you know that West must hold the \HQ. If he also holds the \SK you will be able to squeeze him in \Hs and \Ss.

You let the \HK win, (hoping he will play another \H), but he plays a small trump instead which you win in your hand. 

Then take your 3 \C winners, ending in your hand. 

Discard the \S5 from dummy on the third \D.  

But when you play the \D7 he is squeezed.

He cannot dump his \SK because you would throw the \H8 and dummy would be high.

So he will discard the \HT instead. At this point you know that the \SQ is worthless so you discard it. You win the final two tricks with the \HA and \HJ.}

[Result ""]
{South is to play 4\H. West leads the \CJ. East wins \C A K Q then switches to a trump.

You must win the next T tricks but you only have 9 winners.

East opened 1NT, showing 15-17 points, and West has already produced 2 Jacks. So both the \SQ and \DK are with East and you will have to put the squeeze on him. 

Since you need all the tricks the count is already rectified.

You plan to squeeze East by running the long \Hs in your hand, but the problem is that the \DQ is not a Threat card yet. To make it a Threat you need to unblock dummy's \DA. So play the \DA, then pull trumps with the \H A Q. 

With 6 cards left to be played you are ready to apply pressure to East.

Play the \H 9 8, discarding \Ds from dummy. East is not troubled yet, he can discard the \DJ and the \S3. 

Play the \H6 and throw dummy's \D6.

East can choose his fate. If he throws the \S9 you will know that his \SQ will drop since his third card MUST be the \DK. So you would just play to the high \Ss and the \SJ would be good.

Or, he can throw his \DK which makes your \DQ a winner. 

Let's back up and pretend you had NOT unblocked the \DA. We will just add one \D to everybody's hand and look at the ending.

Now when you play your \H6 as a squeeze card you have a problem. You are squeezing dummy, not East.

If you discard the \D6 East will throw his \DJ, then sit back and wait for his \SQ trick.

But if you discard dummy's \SJ instead, East will match that by throwing his \S9, then sit back and wait for his \DK trick.

Only by visualizing the ending and using the Vienna Coup can this hand be made.}

{South is to play 6\C. West leads the \HK.

In case the squeeze becomes necessary you should rectify the count, so you win the first trick, pull trumps in two rounds, then give up a \H trick. 

You now make the key play of taking dummy's \SA before running three rounds of \Cs. 

As you see, East was able to find discards on your first three trump leads, but when you play the \C7 and discard dummy's \S2 he is squeezed.

He can see that if he discards a \D dummy will be high, so he will probably throw the \SK in hopes that his partner holds the \SQ. But you have that card and you make the slam. 

The only difference would be that to rectify the count you would have to hold up once on the opening \HK.}
