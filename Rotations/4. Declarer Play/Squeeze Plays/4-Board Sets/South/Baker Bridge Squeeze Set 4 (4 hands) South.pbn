{South is to play 7NT. West leads the \HK.

Then, your second thought should be that dummy's \HJ is a Threat against West's \HQ, so if it is West who holds 4 \Ss you will be able to squeeze him.

Since the contract is 7NT you take the first trick with the \HA. 

You continue with the \DQ and \D K, East discarding a \H and a \C. 

To find out for sure you play \SA, then \SQ. Sure enough West discards a \H on the second round. 

But now a completely new possibility shows up. Say to yourself, over and over, "West must guard \Hs, and East must guard \Ss. Nobody can guard \Cs."

You start playing dummy's \D winners. 

When you play the \D5 East must keep both \Ss to guard against your \S7. So he discards the \C6, hoping partner can stop that suit.

Your \S7 is now worthless so you throw it.

West has no problem, (yet), he discards the \HT. 

Play dummy's \S5 to your \SK.

West MUST keep his \HQ so he releases his \C5.

And you win the last three tricks with \CK, \CA, \C8.

This is called a Double Squeeze.}

{South is to play 7NT. West leads the \SQ.

So take the \SK and play \C A K Q.

West discards a \S on the third \C. 

Before tackling \Ds, see what you can discover about \Ss.

Play the \SA. East discards a \H. 

West guards the \Ss. Nobody can guard the \Hs.

Play 4 rounds of \Ds. 

You discarded a small \S. West discarded a \S on the third \D and a \H on the fourth.

Play dummy's \D4. East cannot throw the \CJ or he will set up dummy's \C8, so he discards a \H.

You discard the \S7.

Now West is squeezed. He cannot discard the \SJ or he will set up dummy's \S9, so he discards a \H.

You win the last three \H tricks with another Double Squeeze.}

{South is to play 6\H. West leads the \SA, then \SK.

Even looking at all four hands here it is still very difficult to come up with a plan.

Here's a hint: If West holds 3 \Cs, (and you see that he does), can you squeeze him in \Cs and \Ss? 

The big problem with trying to squeeze West in the black suits right now is that East actually holds a \S guard. But you can fix that.

Play dummy's \HQ and \HT, then ruff a \S, then pull the last trump.  

Then lead dummy's \C7 to your \CK. 

Only West can guard dummy's \ST, and only West can guard dummy's\C9.

So you play your \HA and West must give up one of his guards. If he holds on to the \SJ then you toss dummy's useless \ST. If he throws the \SJ then you toss dummy's \C9.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \S3. East plays the \S5.

You have 8 winners, and if East holds 4+ \Hs AND 3+ \Ds then only he can guard the two suits.

But how can you squeeze him? 

But maybe you can make his partner do the job for you.

At trick 2 you play a \S. 

And he will no doubt continue with the \SA and \S9.

You discard 2 \Ds from dummy and a \C from your hand.

East cannot spare either a \H or a \D so he also throws a \C. 

West will almost surely cash his \S2.

You and dummy both discard a \C and East also must discard a \C.

It doesn't matter what West plays next, lets say it is a \C. 

East is truly squeezed. If he discards a \H, dummy's \H5 will become a winner. but if he discards a \D then you will get a third \D trick and the contract.

Since it was West who started the squeeze by cashing his last \S, this is called a Suicide Squeeze. BUT, what if West had not cashed that \S? 

Suppose West is a really expert defender and avoids the Suicide Squeeze by just refusing to cash his winning \S. It doesn't matter what else he plays instead, so let us assume it is a \C.

You win in your hand and establish a \D winner by playing \DA, \DK, and a small \D. East wins but cannot reach his partner's hand for that good \S.

So you establish a \D winner and make your contract.}
