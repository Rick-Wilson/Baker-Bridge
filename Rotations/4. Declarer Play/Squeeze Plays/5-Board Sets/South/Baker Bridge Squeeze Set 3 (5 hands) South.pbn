{South is to play 6NT. West leads the \HJ. East wins the \HA and returns the \H2.

No matter how the \Ss split only one defender will hold the Guard because only one defender can have as many as 4. IF (it's a big IF) that same defender holds the \CK then you can squeeze him.

Can you see how the squeeze is going to work? 

The solution is the Vienna Coup. Play a \C to the \CA at trick 3.

Then start running the \D suit. 

So far neither defender is hurting, but that is about to change.

You play your \D3 and discard dummy's \CT.

East is squeezed. He can't throw his \CK without letting your \CQ become a winner. But if he discards a \S dummy's \S5 will win the last trick. This is soooo much fun.}

{South is to play 6\H. West leads the \SQ. East wins the \SA and plays the \DK.

In this hand dummy's fourth \C is an obvious Threat, so you should ask yourself if you can find another Threat for when \Cs don't split 3-3. Another thing you have probably noticed is that although 3-3 splits happen about 40% of the time in real life, they NEVER happen in these pages! 

Play 5 \H winners and the \SK. 

Play your \H2 and dump dummy's \D6.

East has no answer.}

{South is to play 7NT. West leads the \HK.

Then, your second thought should be that dummy's \HJ is a Threat against West's \HQ, so if it is West who holds 4 \Ss you will be able to squeeze him.

Since the contract is 7NT you take the first trick with the \HA. 

You continue with the \DQ and \D K, East discarding a \H and a \C. 

To find out for sure you play \SA, then \SQ. Sure enough West discards a \H on the second round. 

But now a completely new possibility shows up. Say to yourself, over and over, "West must guard \Hs, and East must guard \Ss. Nobody can guard \Cs."

You start playing dummy's \D winners. 

When you play the \D5 East must keep both \Ss to guard against your \S7. So he discards the \C6, hoping partner can stop that suit.

Your \S7 is now worthless so you throw it.

West has no problem, (yet), he discards the \HT. 

Play dummy's \S5 to your \SK.

West MUST keep his \HQ so he releases his \C5.

And you win the last three tricks with \CK, \CA, \C8.

This is called a Double Squeeze.}

{South is to play 7NT. West leads the \SQ.

So take the \SK and play \C A K Q.

West discards a \S on the third \C. 

Before tackling \Ds, see what you can discover about \Ss.

Play the \SA. East discards a \H. 

West guards the \Ss. Nobody can guard the \Hs.

Play 4 rounds of \Ds. 

You discarded a small \S. West discarded a \S on the third \D and a \H on the fourth.

Play dummy's \D4. East cannot throw the \CJ or he will set up dummy's \C8, so he discards a \H.

You discard the \S7.

Now West is squeezed. He cannot discard the \SJ or he will set up dummy's \S9, so he discards a \H.

You win the last three \H tricks with another Double Squeeze.}

{South is to play 6\H. West leads the \SA, then \SK.

Even looking at all four hands here it is still very difficult to come up with a plan.

Here's a hint: If West holds 3 \Cs, (and you see that he does), can you squeeze him in \Cs and \Ss? 

The big problem with trying to squeeze West in the black suits right now is that East actually holds a \S guard. But you can fix that.

Play dummy's \HQ and \HT, then ruff a \S, then pull the last trump.  

Then lead dummy's \C7 to your \CK. 

Only West can guard dummy's \ST, and only West can guard dummy's\C9.

So you play your \HA and West must give up one of his guards. If he holds on to the \SJ then you toss dummy's useless \ST. If he throws the \SJ then you toss dummy's \C9.}
