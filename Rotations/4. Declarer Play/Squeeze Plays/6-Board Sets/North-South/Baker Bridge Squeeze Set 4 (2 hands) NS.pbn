{North is to play 6\H. East leads the \DK. Perhaps you wouldn't have bid slam with South's cards, but he has been watching you pull off some fantastic squeeze plays and he has every confidence you will do it again.

And you are 99.9% sure he also has the \SA, so dummy's \SK will also be a Threat card against him.

You should be able to squeeze him in the two suits. What is your first act? 

But not this defender, not this time.

He exits with the \H3 which you take with your \HQ. 

You throw a \S from dummy and East discards \Ss and \Ds. 

Discard the \ST and \D7 from dummy.

East discards the \SQ and \S9. 

He obviously is not going to throw his \SA and make dummy high, so he will instead bare his \DQ.

So you dump dummy's \SK and win the last two tricks with the \DA and then the \DJ.}

{North's 2\H cue-bid shows \S support and at least a limit-raise or better. South is to play 4\S. West leads the \HA, then a \H to East's \HK. East plays a third round of \Hs.

The reason you are seeing it like this is that you must do some deducing first.

You saw the bidding and you know that West started with the \HA and East started with the \HK.

Before you can make a good Plan you need to figure out where the \SA, \DK and \CK are located. 

Now on with the plan. East/West took the first two \H tricks and then played a third \H which you won, discarding the \D2 from dummy.  

This pulls all the trumps and also serves to rectify the count for your upcoming squeeze.

**By the way, notice that if East had played any other way he would have handed you the contract. 

So dummy's \DQ cannot be one of the Threat cards. Instead you must make the \DJ in YOUR hand a Threat. You do that by playing the \DA immediately, a Vienna Coup. 

Overtake dummy's \ST and run three more \Ss.

Discard all three \Ds from dummy.

East will discard his 2 \Hs, the \D9 and the \C6. 

Play your \S2 and discard dummy's \C4.

Poor East will squirm and try to figure out which discard is best because he doesn't actually KNOW what two cards you have left.

But you aren't squirming because you know that whichever card he throws it will give you your contract.}
