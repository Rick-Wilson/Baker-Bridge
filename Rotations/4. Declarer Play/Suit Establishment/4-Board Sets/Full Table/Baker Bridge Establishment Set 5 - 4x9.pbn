{South's 3\D bid was a transfer to \Hs, and his 2NT bid showed exactly 5 \Hs with an invitational strength hand. North is to play 3NT. East leads the \S6, you play dummy's \S9 and  West contributes the \S2.

Winners:   \S=2  \H=0  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 5

The math is easy - you need 4 \H tricks. And you should be able to manage that by driving out the \HA. But the defenders will probably hold up one or two rounds when you play on \Hs, so you must have an outside entry to dummy. 

The \S Q J will provide that entry IF you make sure to win the first trick with your \SA as an unblocking move. If you don't do so then East will be able to keep you out of the dummy and away from those good \Hs.

But if you win the first trick with the \SA, then dummy's \S Q J will provide a guaranteed entry to the good \Hs.}

{East is to play 3NT. South leads the \S2, you play dummy's \S4 and  North plays the \S8.

Winners:   \S=3  \H=0  \D=2  \C=2  Total = 7

Needing just two more winners it looks straightforward to establish dummy's \H suit. Suppose you win the \ST and play the \H9. If the defenders win this trick you are home free. You win their \S return with your \SA, then continue \Hs to drive out their last stopper while you still have the \SK as a dummy entry.

This won't work against good defenders, who will hold up on the first \H trick and win the second. Then when they continue \Ss you won't have another \H to return to dummy, so while you can use the \SK as an entry to establish the \Hs you will never get back to use the good ones.

Instead you should win the first trick with your \SA. Now when you attack \Hs a defensive holdup won't hurt you because you have TWO \S entries, the \SJ by a finesse and the \SK.

So the \S finesse is an odds-on play to get a second dummy entry.}

{3NT would have been a lot easier, but you didn't get there. South is to play 5\D. West leads the \ST.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=1  \D=0  \C=2  Total = 3

The good news is that you only have one loser to get rid of. The bad news is that there doesn't seem to be a good place to put it.

Unlikely as it seems, your best candidate for establishment is dummy's \S8. West is marked with 3 \Ss, and having led the \ST there is a good chance that he also has the \S9. If so you can ruff it out.

Cover the \ST with dummy's \SJ, and when East plays one of his honors ruff in your hand. Play a trump to the \DT, East showing out. Lead the \SQ. East will be forced to play his other high honor, (if he doesn't you would discard a loser), and you ruff again. 

Back to dummy with the \DQ and ruff the \S2 with a high trump just to be safe. West drops the \S9 on this trick.

Pull West's last trump and enter dummy with the \HA and FINALLY discard a loser on the now established \S8.

Here you needed \S T 9 x to be with West if you were to make the contract so you played for just that holding.}

{West is to play 6\S. North leads the \S5.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=1  \D=1  \C=0  Total = 2

First pull trumps with the \SA and \SQ, both defenders following. Next you must establish dummy's \C suit to get rid of one of your losers. If the suit splits 3-3 that will be easy since you have two dummy entries, one to get there to ruff the third \C and the other to get there to enjoy playing the winners. But \Cs will probably split 4-2 so the two entries won't be enough. Here's how to make the defenders help you establish the suit.

After pulling trumps, play the \C A K, then \DA. Next exit with a small \D.

 to see the position. 

The defender who won the \D trick has a problem. If he plays another \D you will get a ruff-sluff, and if he plays a \H you will play for the \HQ and \HJ to be in different hands. So he will probably play a \C.

You ruff in your hand, play a trump to dummy's \SK and ruff the \C8, establishing the \C9 while you still have the \H entry. 

This was a combination of Suit Establishment and End-play. The lesson on Eliminations contains a lot more of this type of hand.}
