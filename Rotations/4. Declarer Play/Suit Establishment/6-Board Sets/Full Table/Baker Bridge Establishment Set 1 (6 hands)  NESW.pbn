{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \SJ.

Winners:   \S=3  \H=1  \D=0  \C=1  Total = 5

You need 4 more winners, and they will come from the \D suit once you have knocked out the \DA. But there is one danger to avoid - if the defenders don't take the \DA on the first round dummy won't have a \D to lead back to your hand. So to make sure you have an entry back you win the first trick with dummy's \SK, saving your \SQ.

Next start playing \Ds, first \DQ, then \DK. Assume the defenders take their \DA on the second round.

Win whatever they now play and come to your hand with the \SQ to enjoy your three established \Ds for 9 tricks total.

Just don't foul up on your \S entry.}

{You were counting on West to have a little better hand than that\East is to play 4\S. South leads the \S6, North plays \S4.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=0  \C=2  Total = 4

You must find a place for one of those losers and that will mean establishing the \D suit. If \Ds split 3-3 that will be pretty easy so you should plan to deal with a 4-2 split. Dummy entries are limited so win the first trick in your hand with the \SA.

Before you pull any trumps you start on the \Ds by playing \DA, \DK and then ruffing a \D with the \SK. South follows to the first two, then discards a \H.

Play a small trump to dummy's \ST (North shows out) and ruff another \D with the \SJ.

Dummy's last \D is now good. Play a \S to the \SQ, (pulling South's last trump), and discard a \H or \C loser on the \D8.

And once again you had to pay close attention to entries.}

{North's \C bid was Stayman, but he didn't match \Ss. South is to play 3NT. West leads the \DJ, East plays \DK.

Winners:   \S=2  \H=1  \D=2  \C=3  Total = 8

With the \DK onside you have 8 tricks, and only need one more. If \Cs split 3-3 you can get 2 extras and make an overtrick. But when you are missing 6 cards they are more likely to be 4-2 than 3-3. Since you only need 4 \C tricks you should establish the suit with a duck.

Win the \DA and play a small \C from each hand.

The defense gets a cheap trick in \Cs but you don't mind because you still have a small \C for an entry to dummy. You win whatever they return and take the rest of your winners, including 4 tricks in \Cs!

{West is to play 3NT. North leads the \H5, South plays the \H2.

Winners:   \S=2  \H=2  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 7

You are very lucky. Apparently North led from \H K Q so you won an undeserved \H trick. Now, if \Cs split 2-2 you can make 12 tricks!But hold it a minute. If you play dummy's two top \Cs and they DON'T split 2-2 you will only  win two \C tricks and the contract will fail. Instead you should play a small \C from dummy right now. The defenders will win the trick easily, but you will win their return and you will still have a \C to get to dummy's 6 \C winners!

{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \S2, West plays the \SJ.

Winners:   \S=2  \H=2  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 7

You need two more winners and dummy's \Dsuit is your only hope. IF \Ds split 3-2 and IF the defenders don't take too many winners in their suit(s) you can establish \Ds by ducking twice.

Win the first \S. If you hold up they might pocket the \S trick and switch to another suit where you only have two stoppers.

Next play a small \D from each hand. Win the return (probably a \S) and duck a second \D.

If the defenders can only take 2 \S tricks now you are home-free since dummy's 3 \Ds are now established.

But in fact you were pretty sure they were going to do so. Since East's \S2 was probably his fourth-down then he couldn't have a fifth-down.}

{West's 3\D bid was a transfer to \Hs. East is to play 3NT. South leads the \S2.

Winners:   \S=2  \H=0  \D=2  \C=1  Total = 5

Obviously you need to establish 4 \H winners and by driving out the \HA you can manage that handily. The problem is that dummy has only one sure entry, (the \SA), and the defenders may be good enough to hold up their \HA twice.

To assure the contract you should win the first trick in your hand with the \SK. Then play \HQ, \HJ overtaking with dummy's \HK so you can continue establishing the suit while you still have that \S entry.
