{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \DK.

Winners:   \S=4  \H=0  \D=1  \C=1  Total = 6

You need 3 more winners, and they must come from the \H suit. The danger is that when you knock out the \HA, East may take too many \Ds. To exhaust West of \Ds you hold-up your \DA until the third round.

Next you start on \Hs by playing \HK, then overtaking the \HT. Assume that West wins the second \H.

You were fortunate it was West who took the \HA, and that he has no \D to return. If he plays a \H or a \S you will win in dummy. If he plays a \C you will jump up with the \CA and take your winners, 9 in all.

But if you had not held-up your \DA even good luck wouldn't have helped you.}

{East is to play 3NT. South leads the \SK.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=0  \C=2  Total = 5

Even if \Hs split 3-3 you could only get 2 extra winners there, so it should be clear that you must establish the \Ds. You will have to drive out the \DA and hope they don't win too many \Ss at that time. You can help your chances by a hold-up of the \SA until the third round.

Having just taken the third \S trick you now work on \Ds by first playing the \DK, then continuing the suit. North wins the third one with his \DA. And now the good news - he has no \S left to reach his partner's good tricks. So North plays the \HQ.

At this point in the play you have three tricks in the bank; \SA, \DK, \DQ. You take your \HK, cash the two good \Ds, then lead to dummy for the \CA K and \HA. Voila!  

But what if North actually held 4 \Ss? No problem, in that case the \Ss would have split 4-4 so the defenders could only win 3 \S tricks and the \DA.

The hold-up lets you make the contract whenever North holds the \DA. And if South happened to hold the \DA??? You go down.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \S3. East wins the first trick with the \SA and returns the \S8.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=1  \C=3  Total = 7

You can win 3 more \D tricks if the finesse works, but even if it doesn't work you can still get the 2 that you need. Of course if East does win the \DK it would sure be great if he had no \S to lead. So you duck the second \S and take your \SK when they play a third round.

After winning the \SK you are conveniently in your hand, so you play the \DQ and let it ride when West plays a low card. Alas, East takes the trick with his \DK.

It's too bad the finesse didn't work, but it's not too too bad! Because East is out of \Ss and must lead one of the other suits. You don't care which he leads because you can now win 8 more tricks and make your contract.

And as long as you had held up on the \SK until the third round you could ensure that East was out of \Ss if he had started with only 3.}

{West is to play 3NT. North leads the \DK.

Winners:   \S=3  \H=2  \D=1  \C=0  Total = 6

You will need some \C tricks to make the contract. If North has 5 \Ds and also the \CA then you will go down. It doesn't matter if he has the \CQ because you can finesse him out of that.

But in the case where South has both the \C A Q you need to make sure he has no \D when he takes his first trick. So hold up the \DA until the third round, everybody following.

Now start on the \Cs. Play your \C9 and let it ride. South wins the \CQ and returns a \S. Good, he didn't have the fourth \D.

Win with dummy's \SQ and force out the \CA.

The rest of the tricks are yours, nine in all.

But with this layout you needed to hold up twice.}
