{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \C5. You play low from dummy and West plays the \C6. 

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 1  \D = 4?    \C = 3 Total = 9

Although you have 4 \D winners, getting to the last couple might not be so easy. You can make 3 \D tricks simply by winning your \DA, then overtaking your \DJ with dummy's \DQ. But you need that fourth \D winner. Can you get it?

Sure you can, by creating an entry in \Cs. It is likely from the opening lead, (and West's play of a small card), that East has led from \C Q T 7 5. If you win the first trick cheaply then you will still make your \C A K for three \C tricks in all.

So don't win cheaply, win the first trick with the \CA. Then unblock your \D A J. Next play \CK. (on which West discards), and a small \C toward dummy's \C J 9. You are sure to have a \C entry to dummy's \Ds, and you will still get three \C tricks, just a different three.

You probably would have played the hand the same way you just did, unblock \Ds, then play \C A K and a low \C toward the \C J 9 trying to get a \C entry to dummy.

It is only because the \C opening lead gives you the chance for a Cheap-Trick that you are tempted to go wrong.}

{East is to play 3NT. South leads the \SQ. North plays the \SK, then the \S2 when you hold up. 

Winners:   \S=1  \H=0  \D=4  \C=1  Total = 6

You are going to have to be pretty lucky to make this contract. You cannot touch the \H suit because a defender would take the \HA and it would start raining \Ss.

So you will have to get 3 extra \C winners, which means the \C finesse absolutely MUST work.

In addition to lucky, you are going to have to be pretty good, too. You will surely have to finesse the \Cs at least twice; that means you need two dummy entries. Can you find them?

Maybe in \Ds. Play the \DK, then \DQ, watching the defender's cards carefully. When both follow twice you know there is only a single \D left out, so you play the \DJ to dummy's \DA. Now take the \C finesse. It works! Next play your \D5 to dummy's \D6 and take another \C finesse. Both defenders follow so your \Cs are good.

Then your chance of success goes way down. You would have to find North with the doubleton \CK.}

{South is to play 6\C. West leads the \DQ.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=1  \C=0  Total = 3

Partner's hand didn't turn out to be what you hoped for, you had in mind maybe the \HK and \DQ.

But this is what you got. First, be thankful West led a \D rather than a \H. Second, see if you can find a way to fight yourself over to dummy and those three beautiful \Ss.

You have two possibilities for a \C entry, but you can only try one of them as you will see.

You can play a high \C and hope somebody plays the singleton \CT. Then your \C9 would be an entry. If this works you would probably make all 13 tricks, but the chances are very slim.

You can play a low \C to dummy's \C8. Assuming a defender takes the \CT you can win his return and enter dummy with the \C9. This play is guaranteed to give you the entry and is the one you should choose.

When you are missing 4 cards the probability of a 3-1 split is about 50%.

But the singleton can be any one of four cards - in this case it can be the \CT, \C6, \C3 or \C2. So the chance of one of the opponents holding specifically the singleton \CT is only one-fourth of 50%, about 12.5%.}

{West is to play 4\H. North leads the \SA, then \SK.

Losers:   \S = 1    \H = 0  \D = 3?    \C = 0 Total = 4?

This is the kind of hand that can get really messy if you aren't careful. You could ruff the \S, then try to ruff some \Ds, but the defense can prevent you by leading trumps when you give up the \D tricks. 

All in all a much better plan is to use dummy's \C suit after you unblock the Ace. The only flaw with that idea is that when you ruff the \S, unblock the \CA, then play two rounds of trumps ending in dummy, there will still be a trump left out. And the defender might ruff a \C before you can take the discards you need. Do you see a way around this?

Do NOT ruff the second \S in dummy, just discard a \D. If North plays a third \S you will ruff in your hand, then unblock the \CA, then pull trumps in 3 rounds ending in dummy. And run all those \C tricks. If North plays a trump or a \C the result will be the same. The defense can get one \D trick if they take it right now, but you still make your contract.

{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \C3, West plays the \CA.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 6

You have the possibility of one additional \S winner if East holds the \SK. However, \Ds is your best suit and if West holds the \DK you could gain all three winners that you need from that suit. But of course you need perhaps 2 dummy entries. Do you have them?

Well, you probably do. East's small \C lead probably indicates an honor, and with West playing the \CA you can be pretty sure that East holds the \CJ. So by playing your \CK underneath the \CA you set up a second entry to dummy via the \C finesse.

Assume West now plays a \H. Take your \HA and play a \C to dummy's \CT. Lead a \D and finesse the \DJ, which holds. Play another \C to dummy and finesse another \D. Now play your \DA and smile when the \DK drops and your fourth \D becomes a winner.

By unblocking the \CK you were still pretty confident that you would get the two tricks, but the bonus was in the extra dummy entry your unblock created.}

{East is to play 3NT. South leads the \D5, North plays the \DQ.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=3  \D=1  \C=1  Total = 5

You must take the \DK right now or you might lose the first 5 tricks.

It's a shame about that solid \S suit, but if you try to win even a single \S they will grab the \SA and win enough \D tricks to set the contract.

So you are going to have to win a lot of \C tricks, and do so without losing the lead. You need dummy entries, and they must be in \Hs.

Win the \DK. Play the \HJ to dummy's \HQ. Play the \CQ and when North follows with a low card let it ride. Still in dummy, play the \CJ, again letting it ride when North plays low. Play one more \C to your \CA, picking up North's \CK this time.

The \C suit is ready to run, so play your \HK to dummy's \HA and take your \C winners. You took 9 tricks in all, the \DK, the \H A Q and all 6 \Cs.

Since it gave you all 6 \C tricks the sacrifice was well worth it.}
