{North is to play 6NT. East leads the \ST.

Winners:   \S = 2    \H = 5  \D = 2    \C = 1 Total = T

You need two more winners and the best bet is to try to pick up three \C tricks. You will need the \CK and \CQ to lie in different hands, or both of them to be with West. That is about a 75% chance.

But you may need to make 3 finesses, so that means 3 entries to dummy, all of which must be in the \H suit. Can it be done?

Of course it can. Win the \S lead in your hand and play the \HK, overtaking with dummy's \HA. Now play a \C to your \C9, which loses to East's \CK. East plays another \S.

Now play the \HT, and when East follows you are safe to overtake with dummy's \HJ since you can tell that West did not start with 4 \Hs. In fact, West shows out so it is East who started with 4 \Hs but that won't be a problem for you. Play another \C from dummy, finessing the \CT which wins.

Now play your \H3 toward dummy, finessing the \H8 when East follows with a low card. Play dummy's two \H winners, discarding \Ds,  then the low \C to your \CJ. Wow.

And as you have figured by now, assessing how many entries you are going to need is big part of that plan. Like here, if you had won a single \H trick in your hand then you wouldn't have had the three entries to dummy.}

{Pretty bold bidding by East, but partner DID make a positive response. East is to play 6\S. South leads the \DQ.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=0  \D=2  \C=1  Total = 3

OK, the plan is to get over to dummy for those two \H winners.

If you just play a small \C toward the \CQ that will work whenever South holds the \CK.

How about playing \CA an a small \C, planning on ruffing your third \C to get to dummy? Naaah. They will win the second \C and play a trump.

There is actually a play that is T0% certain, no matter who holds the \CK.

Win the opening lead and lay down your \CJ. The defense is helpless. If they take the \CJ with the \CK, then you have a dummy entry in the form of the \CQ. If they refuse to take the trick you will counter by next laying down the \CA, then ruffing a third \C to get to dummy and the two golden eggs.

My dream is that someday I will get a chance to use it at the table. If you ever do be sure and email me.}
