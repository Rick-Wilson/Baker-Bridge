{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \C3.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=5  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 8

You only need one more winner and your \S K Q will provide it. So, is there anything that could go wrong? - - Like could you mess up your entry?

Suppose you play the \CJ from dummy on the first trick. And then suppose West puts the \CQ on. If you take your \CA you have used your entry to the \S K Q before you established one of them. But if you don't take the trick East will play another \C to remove dummy's \CK with the same effect. So what should you do?

It's easy once you think about it. Just win the opening lead with dummy's \CK. Then, while it's fresh in your mind play to your \S K Q to establish the one extra winner you need. Then it's just a question of taking your winners.

Making a plan before they play to the first trick is one of the strengths of winning bridge players.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \D5. You play the \D9 from dummy and East plays the \D4.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=2  \C=0  Total = 5

The bad news is that you must come up with 4 more winners!The good news is dummy's \C suit.

You can drive out the \CA, then get over to dummy for those \C winners. You will be able to get over to dummy, won't you?

Not if you let the \D9 hold the first trick. The defender with the \CA will hold it up until the third round, then West will be able to play his \DK so as to prevent you from entering dummy.

But take first trick with the \DA and the \D Q J will be there guaranteeing you an entry to those two good \Cs.

But look carefully at the \D situation. You are going to get exactly two \D tricks no matter when you play your \DA. So you don't lose a trick, but you do gain an entry.}

Winners:   \S=2  \H=0  \D=1  \C=1  Total = 4

Looks like you're going to need some \D tricks. Lots of them. And it also looks like you are going to have to be very careful with entries, which shouldn't surprise you at this time. So what is your first key move?

The \C situation is exactly the same as the \Ds in Deal 2, but flipped North to South. And you must handle it exactly the same way - jump up with the \CA right away to preserve the \C Q J combination as a sure entry to your hand.

Having done that, are your problems (and thinking) over?

Not quite, there is one more hurdle to hurdle. You must put all thought of a \D finesse far out of your mind. Play \DA, then \DT, overtaking with \DJ and continuing the suit until the King appears. Now you should be able to come to 9 tricks unless there is a very unfortunate distribution which lets the defenders score 3 \H tricks along with their 1 \C and 1 \D.

{South is to play 4\H. West leads the \CA, \C K, \CQ.

Losers:   \S=1  \H=0  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 4

There is nothing to be done about the 2 \Cs you've already lost, and the \D loser is also inescapable. So you cannot afford a \S loser which means you will have to find the \SK with East and finesse him out of it.

That won't be a problem, will it?

No, no problem. You will probably have to finesse twice so you will need two dummy entries, but the trump suit will provide both of those, the \HA and \H7, as long as you saved your \H5 for the second entry. Wait a minute, you surely didn't ruff that \C with your \H5 did you? Surely you ruffed with the \H8?

So, you ruffed the \C with the \H8, pulled one round of trumps with the \HK, pulled the last trump by playing \H9 to \HA and finessed the \S. Then \H5 to \H7, finesse the \S a second time. Play \SA and ruff the fourth \S in dummy.

 to see it all. 

Ask yourself if you would have done the correct thing at the table, say playing for the Bermuda Bowl championship.}
