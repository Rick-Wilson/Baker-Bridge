{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \C3, West plays the \CA.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 6

You have the possibility of one additional \S winner if East holds the \SK. However, \Ds is your best suit and if West holds the \DK you could gain all three winners that you need from that suit. But of course you need perhaps 2 dummy entries. Do you have them?

Well, you probably do. East's small \C lead probably indicates an honor, and with West playing the \CA you can be pretty sure that East holds the \CJ. So by playing your \CK underneath the \CA you set up a second entry to dummy via the \C finesse.

Assume West now plays a \H. Take your \HA and play a \C to dummy's \CT. Lead a \D and finesse the \DJ, which holds. Play another \C to dummy and finesse another \D. Now play your \DA and smile when the \DK drops and your fourth \D becomes a winner.

By unblocking the \CK you were still pretty confident that you would get the two tricks, but the bonus was in the extra dummy entry your unblock created.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \D5, East plays the \DQ.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=3  \D=1  \C=1  Total = 5

You must take the \DK right now or you might lose the first 5 tricks.

It's a shame about that solid \S suit, but if you try to win even a single \S they will grab the \SA and win enough \D tricks to set the contract.

So you are going to have to win a lot of \C tricks, and do so without losing the lead. You need dummy entries, and they must be in \Hs.

Win the \DK. Play the \HJ to dummy's \HQ. Play the \CQ and when East follows with a low card let it ride. Still in dummy, play the \CJ, again letting it ride when East plays low. Play one more \C to your \CA, picking up East's \CK this time.

The \C suit is ready to run, so play your \HK to dummy's \HA and take your \C winners. You took 9 tricks in all, the \DK, the \H A Q and all 6 \Cs.

Since it gave you all 6 \C tricks the sacrifice was well worth it.}

{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \H4, you play low in dummy and West plays the \H8.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 5

The winners list looks a little skimpy, but what a nice solid \S suit. It will be a cinch to establish 4 winners in the suit - if only you have an entry to reach them.

You are probably getting good at this by now. The way to make sure of a dummy entry is to pass up the Cheap Trick \H9 and win the first trick with the \HA. Since West did not play third-hand-high he probably doesn't have a high card to play. You are confident that East has led from the \HK so by taking the \HA at once you guarantee you can get back to dummy when you need to do so.

After you win the \HA you start on \Ss, and they hold-up their \SA for one round. But you can get to dummy and the rest of the \Ss by leading toward the \HQ.

Here's a question: How many times at the table have situations like this presented themselves but you didn't realize it? And of course, at the table there is no second page popping up to tell you what you should have done.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \S9, and East plays the \SK.

Winners:   \S=3  \H=2  \D=1  \C=0  Total = 6

I'll bet you got this one. The extra \C tricks you need are winnable only if you can get back to your hand after knocking out the \CA. But the only possible entry card is the \SA. If you use it on the first trick the Defense will hold up their \CA for one trick and your hand will be shot..

So let East keep the first trick, (sacrificing one \S winner), and take the next \S in dummy. Then establish \Cs.

 You sacrifice one \S trick for four \C tricks. A good deal.

There are two basic types; one where you give up a winner to gain an entry, and this type where you get the entry without giving up a thing.

It looks a little different, but the theme is the same. PROTECT YOUR ENTRY.}

{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \H3, you play dummy's \HJ and West plays the \HQ.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=1  \D=4  \C=1  Total = 6

Unless you want to go down really, really early you had better take your \HK right now. And unless you want to go down almost as early you'd better stay completely away from the \S suit. So that only leaves you the \C suit to get 3 more winners in. West will have to have \CK so you can finesse it. You are also going to have to be smart with entries. Got it?

If West has just \C K x then one finesse, followed by the \CA to drop the \CK and a small \C back to dummy will give you the 4 \C winners you must have. But if West has \C K x x and refuses to cover then you will be able to establish the \Cs but will need an extra dummy entry to enjoy that last winner.

So win the \HK and play the \D K Q. If both defenders follow suit you can afford to overtake your \DJ with dummy's \DA. Now play the \CT and let it ride. If it holds the trick play another \C to your \CJ and then play the \CA, dropping West's \CK.

Enter dummy by playing your \D3 to the \D6 and take your established \C for the ninth trick.

With only one outside entry to dummy your choices are limited.

You might play West for \C K x and lead a small to your \CJ, then play \CA.

Or you might try leading the \CQ hoping that West will see this as a time to "cover an honor with an honor".}
