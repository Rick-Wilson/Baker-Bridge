{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \C4, you play dummy's \C5 and West plays the \C7.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=0  \D=2  \C=3  Total = 6

You'd really like to find 3 winners without broaching that \H suit, so you decide to pin your hopes on the \S finesse. But you have a problem. When you win the first trick with the \C9 your only safe entry to dummy is by leading your \CK to the \CA. And this uses up one of your \C winners! Do you see a way to avoid the problem?

Don't win the first trick with the \C9, win with the \CK. Then at trick two enter dummy by playing your \C9 and finessing the \CJ! You are pretty sure East has led from the \CQ so you expect this to work. Then play the \ST, underplaying your \S8. You had better cash the \CA next, then the \SQ, letting it ride if not covered. Finally, one last \S finesse gives you 4 \S winners.

Here it doesn't actually create an extra entry, it just preserves the one entry you have but saves you an actual trick.

Here is an interesting point. Suppose that East's opening lead had been a \H and West had taken the first four \H tricks then played a \D. You would have played the hand the same way! Take the \CK, then finesse the \CJ.}

{East is to play 3NT. South leads the \SQ.

Winners:   \S=2  \H=1  \D=2  \C=0  Total = 5

There they are, four perfectly good \H tricks and no straightforward way to reach them. On the other hand, (I should say "In the other hand"), you have the possibility of 6 \D tricks, if the \DQ drops, in which case you won't need the \H tricks at all. Can you work those two possibilities into a strategy?

Sure. The \D problem is that the outstanding \Ds may split 3-1 with one defender holding \D Q x x. So it would appear you could only get 5 \D winners. But you can thwart him like this.

Win the \S. Unblock the \HA. Now play the \DJ. If Mr. \D Q x x takes this trick dummy's \DT will become an entry to those wonderful \Hs. But if he cleverly refuses to win the \DQ, then it will fall under your \D A K and you will get all 6 \D tricks.

Maybe after the hand is over he will appreciate it more and congratulate you.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \D2.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=3  \C=2  Total = 8

The reason the Winners list shows 1 \S is that the defenders are going to have to let you win dummy's \SK. If they take that then you'll have 4 \S winners in your hand!

So you only need one more winner really, and if you guess the \C finesse right you will have it. Which way will you finesse, and why?

You will finesse through East. If he has the \CQ you will win all 3 \C tricks, but if West has the \CQ you may win even more. Just watch.

Win the opening \D lead in dummy. Play the \SK which the defenders are not about to take while you have a \C entry to your hand. Now play the \CT and pass it to West. If West takes the \CQ then you will have TWO entries to your hand, one to get there for a \S lead, and the other to reach the \S winners after you have driven out the \SA. But if West DOESN'T take the \CQ, or if East actually has it, then you will have 3 \C tricks and your contract.

{West is to play 6NT. North leads the \ST.

Winners:   \S = 2    \H = 5  \D = 2    \C = 1 Total = T

You need two more winners and the best bet is to try to pick up three \C tricks. You will need the \CK and \CQ to lie in different hands, or both of them to be with South. That is about a 75% chance.

But you may need to make 3 finesses, so that means 3 entries to dummy, all of which must be in the \H suit. Can it be done?

Of course it can. Win the \S lead in your hand and play the \HK, overtaking with dummy's \HA. Now play a \C to your \C9, which loses to North's \CK. North plays another \S.

Now play the \HT, and when North follows you are safe to overtake with dummy's \HJ since you can tell that South did not start with 4 \Hs. In fact, South shows out so it is North who started with 4 \Hs but that won't be a problem for you. Play another \C from dummy, finessing the \CT which wins.

Now play your \H3 toward dummy, finessing the \H8 when North follows with a low card. Play dummy's two \H winners, discarding \Ds,  then the low \C to your \CJ. Wow.

And as you have figured by now, assessing how many entries you are going to need is big part of that plan. Like here, if you had won a single \H trick in your hand then you wouldn't have had the three entries to dummy.}

{Pretty bold bidding by North, but partner DID make a positive response. North is to play 6\S. East leads the \DQ.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=0  \D=2  \C=1  Total = 3

OK, the plan is to get over to dummy for those two \H winners.

If you just play a small \C toward the \CQ that will work whenever East holds the \CK.

How about playing \CA an a small \C, planning on ruffing your third \C to get to dummy? Naaah. They will win the second \C and play a trump.

There is actually a play that is T0% certain, no matter who holds the \CK.

Win the opening lead and lay down your \CJ. The defense is helpless. If they take the \CJ with the \CK, then you have a dummy entry in the form of the \CQ. If they refuse to take the trick you will counter by next laying down the \CA, then ruffing a third \C to get to dummy and the two golden eggs.

My dream is that someday I will get a chance to use it at the table. If you ever do be sure and email me.}
