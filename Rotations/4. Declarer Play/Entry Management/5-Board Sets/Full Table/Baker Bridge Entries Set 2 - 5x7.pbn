{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \S5. 

Winners:   \S=3  \H=1  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 7

Needing two winners you will naturally consider your 5-card \C suit. After unblocking the \C A K you will need two entries to your hand; one to lead the \CJ and drive out the \CQ, then a second to enjoy your good \Cs.

The \S suit will provide one entry easily, but should you depend on the \HQ for the second entry?

No, for two reasons. Firstly the \HQ only gives you a 50% chance of being an entry. But more importantly, you already have your two sure entries in \Ss. As long as you take the first trick with dummy's \SA both your \SK and  \SJ can be entries.

Win the \SA. Play off dummy's \C A K. Lead the \S9 to your \SJ. Play your \CJ (and another one if necessary) to establish the \C suit. Win whatever red card they play next with dummy's Ace. Play the \SQ to your \SK and cash your established \C(s). Dummy's other red Ace will be your ninth trick.

You'd have to be very careless to miss this one.}

{East is to play 3NT. South leads the \C5. You play low from dummy and North plays the \C6. 

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 1  \D = 4?    \C = 3 Total = 9

Although you have 4 \D winners, getting to the last couple might not be so easy. You can make 3 \D tricks simply by winning your \DA, then overtaking your \DJ with dummy's \DQ. But you need that fourth \D winner. Can you get it?

Sure you can, by creating an entry in \Cs. It is likely from the opening lead, (and North's play of a small card), that South has led from \C Q T 7 5. If you win the first trick cheaply then you will still make your \C A K for three \C tricks in all.

So don't win cheaply, win the first trick with the \CA. Then unblock your \D A J. Next play \CK. (on which North discards), and a small \C toward dummy's \C J 9. You are sure to have a \C entry to dummy's \Ds, and you will still get three \C tricks, just a different three.

You probably would have played the hand the same way you just did, unblock \Ds, then play \C A K and a low \C toward the \C J 9 trying to get a \C entry to dummy.

It is only because the \C opening lead gives you the chance for a Cheap-Trick that you are tempted to go wrong.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \SQ. East plays the \SK, then the \S2 when you hold up. 

Winners:   \S=1  \H=0  \D=4  \C=1  Total = 6

You are going to have to be pretty lucky to make this contract. You cannot touch the \H suit because a defender would take the \HA and it would start raining \Ss.

So you will have to get 3 extra \C winners, which means the \C finesse absolutely MUST work.

In addition to lucky, you are going to have to be pretty good, too. You will surely have to finesse the \Cs at least twice; that means you need two dummy entries. Can you find them?

Maybe in \Ds. Play the \DK, then \DQ, watching the defender's cards carefully. When both follow twice you know there is only a single \D left out, so you play the \DJ to dummy's \DA. Now take the \C finesse. It works! Next play your \D5 to dummy's \D6 and take another \C finesse. Both defenders follow so your \Cs are good.

Then your chance of success goes way down. You would have to find East with the doubleton \CK.}

{West is to play 6\C. North leads the \DQ.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=1  \C=0  Total = 3

Partner's hand didn't turn out to be what you hoped for, you had in mind maybe the \HK and \DQ.

But this is what you got. First, be thankful North led a \D rather than a \H. Second, see if you can find a way to fight yourself over to dummy and those three beautiful \Ss.

You have two possibilities for a \C entry, but you can only try one of them as you will see.

You can play a high \C and hope somebody plays the singleton \CT. Then your \C9 would be an entry. If this works you would probably make all 13 tricks, but the chances are very slim.

You can play a low \C to dummy's \C8. Assuming a defender takes the \CT you can win his return and enter dummy with the \C9. This play is guaranteed to give you the entry and is the one you should choose.

When you are missing 4 cards the probability of a 3-1 split is about 50%.

But the singleton can be any one of four cards - in this case it can be the \CT, \C6, \C3 or \C2. So the chance of one of the opponents holding specifically the singleton \CT is only one-fourth of 50%, about 12.5%.}

{North is to play 4\H. East leads the \SA, then \SK.

Losers:   \S = 1    \H = 0  \D = 3?    \C = 0 Total = 4?

This is the kind of hand that can get really messy if you aren't careful. You could ruff the \S, then try to ruff some \Ds, but the defense can prevent you by leading trumps when you give up the \D tricks. 

All in all a much better plan is to use dummy's \C suit after you unblock the Ace. The only flaw with that idea is that when you ruff the \S, unblock the \CA, then play two rounds of trumps ending in dummy, there will still be a trump left out. And the defender might ruff a \C before you can take the discards you need. Do you see a way around this?

Do NOT ruff the second \S in dummy, just discard a \D. If East plays a third \S you will ruff in your hand, then unblock the \CA, then pull trumps in 3 rounds ending in dummy. And run all those \C tricks. If East plays a trump or a \C the result will be the same. The defense can get one \D trick if they take it right now, but you still make your contract.
