{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \HQ.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=4  \C=1  Total = 7

Needing two more winners you will have to make both the \SK and \SQ. This will only be possible if West holds the \SA. Win the first trick (if you don't West might switch to \Cs) and play a small \S toward dummy's \SQ. It holds the trick.

You should take your four \D winners now, being sure to end up in your hand. Then play another small \S toward dummy's \SK. This also wins.

You have now won 7 tricks so don't mess around now. Take your two Aces and let them have the last four tricks.

A Simple Finesse has only a 50% success rate. That's why we only take finesses as a last resort.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \D3.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=5  \D=1  \C=1  Total = 8

You need just one more winner. Since West probably has 4 \Ds you will not be able to establish a trick in that suit, so your only hope is the \SQ. You win the first \D so they don't get a chance to switch to \Cs, a suit you are worse off in. Then take your 5 \H tricks, ending in dummy.

You can't put it off any longer so play a small \S from dummy and put the \SQ on. If it wins you will make your contract, if it loses you won't.

But remember, finesses only work half the time. The other half they lose.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \HQ.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=2  \C=4  Total = 8

Needing one more winner you should see right away that it cannot come from \Hs, \Ds, or \Cs. That means you must hope that East has the \SA. Win the first \H, then play your 4 \C winners ending in dummy.

The moment of truth. You lead a small \S from dummy. East plays low and you play the \SK.

Unfortunately West takes your \SK with the \SA. He then plays another \H and you at least make 8 tricks but have no hope for a ninth one so you go down 1.

 to see the bad news. 

Welcome to the real world.}

{South is to play 4\H. West leads the \SK.

Losers:   \S=2  \H=1  \D=0  \C=1  Total = 4

West found the best opening lead for his side, exposing your \S losers before you could establish the \C suit for a discard. If you start to pull trumps right away the defense will grab the \HA, then take their two \S tricks and you will still have the \CA that you cannot avoid.

Other than the \DA the only useful card in dummy is the \DQ so you must try to make a winner out of that for a  discard. So win the \SA, lead your singleton \D and finesse the \DQ. Your luck has returned, the \DQ wins and you discard one of your \S losers on the \DA.

At this point you have not lost any tricks, and you can see that you have only 3 losers remaining in your hand. So you start pulling trumps and establishing the \Cs.

The risk was worthwhile though since it gave you your only chance of making the contract.}

{South is to play 6NT. West leads the \S3.

Winners:   \S=4  \H=1  \D=5  \C=1  Total = 11

You need one more winner from the \H or \C suit. The straight finesse of the \HK offers a 50% chance of success. The double finesse of the \C K Q offers a 75% chance of success. It's a no-brainer. Run 4 \Ss and 5 \Ds ending in your hand. Be very careful not to discard a \C from your hand.

Lead a small \C and play the \CT if West plays low. Let's say East wins the \CK and returns a \H.

DO NOT FINESSE THE \H. Stick with your original 75% plan. Take the \HA and play your small \C, finessing the \CJ. This is why you couldn't discard a \C earlier.

The double \C finesse is much better because its success depends on West holding either of two cards, the \CQ OR the \CK.}

{South is to play 4\S. West leads the \DK.

Losers:   \S=1  \H=1  \D=1  \C=1  Total = 4

West has made another great lead. Any other suit would have given you a free finesse. You should duck the first \D. It is very possible that West has led from \D K Q T and will be afraid to continue for fear you have the \DJ in your hand. You'd be very happy to see him switch to any other suit. But he doesn't, he continues with the \DQ which you take with dummy's \DA.

You are in dummy for the first, last, and only time. You need to try a finesse right now, but which one? At first you might think it makes no difference but, in fact, there is only one reasonable choice. If you finesse the \SK successfully you may still have a \S loser. If you finesse the \HK successfully you will surely still have a \H loser. But if you finesse the \CK successfully you will eliminate your \C loser.

But as you can see, only the \C finesse will actually save you a trick.}
