The moment of truth. You lead a small \S from dummy. East plays low and you play the \SK.

Losers:   \S=2  \H=1  \D=0  \C=1  Total = 4

North found the best opening lead for his side, exposing your \S losers before you could establish the \C suit for a discard. If you start to pull trumps right away the defense will grab the \HA, then take their two \S tricks and you will still have the \CA that you cannot avoid.

Other than the \DA the only useful card in dummy is the \DQ so you must try to make a winner out of that for a  discard. So win the \SA, lead your singleton \D and finesse the \DQ. Your luck has returned, the \DQ wins and you discard one of your \S losers on the \DA.

At this point you have not lost any tricks, and you can see that you have only 3 losers remaining in your hand. So you start pulling trumps and establishing the \Cs.

The risk was worthwhile though since it gave you your only chance of making the contract.}

You need one more winner from the \H or \C suit. The straight finesse of the \HK offers a 50% chance of success. The double finesse of the \C K Q offers a 75% chance of success. It's a no-brainer. Run 4 \Ss and 5 \Ds ending in your hand. Be very careful not to discard a \C from your hand.

Lead a small \C and play the \CT if East plays low. Let's say West wins the \CK and returns a \H.

DO NOT FINESSE THE \H. Stick with your original 75% plan. Take the \HA and play your small \C, finessing the \CJ. This is why you couldn't discard a \C earlier.

The double \C finesse is much better because its success depends on East holding either of two cards, the \CQ OR the \CK.}

South has made another great lead. Any other suit would have given you a free finesse. You should duck the first \D. It is very possible that South has led from \D K Q T and will be afraid to continue for fear you have the \DJ in your hand. You'd be very happy to see him switch to any other suit. But he doesn't, he continues with the \DQ which you take with dummy's \DA.

You are in dummy for the first, last, and only time. You need to try a finesse right now, but which one? At first you might think it makes no difference but, in fact, there is only one reasonable choice. If you finesse the \SK successfully you may still have a \S loser. If you finesse the \HK successfully you will surely still have a \H loser. But if you finesse the \CK successfully you will eliminate your \C loser.

But as you can see, only the \C finesse will actually save you a trick.}

Losers:   \S=0  \H=1  \D=2  \C=0  Total = 3

Your only hope for ridding yourself of two of those losers is dummy's \C suit. One possibility would be to finesse West for the \CK, and if that works, discard your \H loser on the \CA. You could then establish another \C winner for one of the \D losers. The problem with that plan is that if the finesse fails the defense will immediately take the setting \H trick.

A better plan is a ruffing finesse. Win the first trick with your \HA and pull trumps with your \S K Q. 

Next play your \C7 to dummy's \CA. Then lead the \CQ from dummy. If East plays the \CK you will ruff, enter dummy, and discard two red losers on the \C J T. If East plays low instead, you discard your \H loser. West may be able to win the trick but you can ruff a \H return, and dummy will have two good \Cs on which you can discard 2 \D losers.

But they are easy to overlook, mainly because we don't use them often.}

You only need one more winner. If South has the \SK you can finesse him out of it. Or, you have a two-way finesse for the \HQ.

It is an easy choice. The defenders only have 12 HCP and North opened the bidding. So you know he must have both of the cards you are interested in.

Hold up the \DA until the third round just to be safe. Then play four rounds of \Cs ending in your hand.

Now play the \HJ. If North doesn't cover, you will let it ride for your ninth trick. But North does cover so you take dummy's \HA, then your other 2 \H tricks. The \SA  is your ninth trick.

Sometimes that may be right. But there are other times when information from the bidding or the opening lead allows you to make a higher-percentage guess.}

The status is pretty clear, you've already lost the 2 \Ds so you have to keep your \C losers to just one. You have a good chance of pulling that off by playing for the \CK and \CQ to lie in different hands and taking two finesses.

But you will only be in dummy once more so you MUST make the first finesse right now. Play a small \C from dummy and play the \CT. South wins with the \CQ and plays another trump.

In dummy for the last time you must now take your second \C finesse. You play a small \C to your \CJ. When the \CJ wins you pull any leftover trumps and your hand is good.

It was probably a better example of watching your entries. If you had pulled another trump before taking that first \C finesse you would not have been able to take the second one.}

You don't really have 2 \H losers since both of them can be ruffed in dummy. The 2 \S losers are real, though, and must be dealt with. If East holds the \SK then a simple finesse will win the contract for you. A 50% chance. But there is more to this Deal than a simple finesse, look at it carefully.

In addition to the trumps, dummy has another useful card, the \HJ. You can give yourself a second chance by playing West to hold the \HQ.

Ruff the opening \C lead, pull trumps with the \DK, (they split 1-1), and play a low \H toward the \HJ. West fidgets, then puts on the \HQ and plays another \C which you ruff.

You are in control now. You play a \H to dummy's \HJ, then a \S back to your \SA. Discard dummy's 2 \S losers on the \H A K and claim your slam.

 to see that this was the only way it would make this time. 

Then you would have to rely on the \S finesse after all. You'd be no worse off because you could still discard one of dummy's \Ss on a big \H.

This method of play gave you two chances instead of just one.}

A. Conan Doyle would have called this "The Tale of Two Queens". You need to find one more trick and to do so you are going to have to find either the \HQ or the \CQ. You can finesse South for the \HQ, and you can finesse either defender for the \CQ.

So which will you choose?

Neither, yet. First take your 8 winners in \Ss and \Ds, hoping somebody discards something to help you. They don't.

Now play the \CA, then \CK, hoping the \CQ falls. If she does you have your thirteenth trick in \Cs. If she doesn't you take the \HK then finesse South for the \HQ. Two chances.

 to see what happened. 

It always pays to look for a second chance. Here you try to drop the \CQ, and if it doesn't work you have the finesse for the \HQ in reserve. 

Why not try to drop the \HQ and keep the finesse for the \CQ in reserve? Because you and dummy had 8 \Cs between you and only 6 \Hs. So the \CQ was far more likely to be doubleton than the \HQ.}

First things first. Win the first \H, do not hold up. East's \H3 indicates he has led a 4-card suit so a hold-up wouldn't help you. And if you did hold up they might pocket their \H trick and switch to \Ds, a suit you are no better off in.

You need to get one more winner and it will have to be a \S winner. You could lead toward the \SQ, winning a trick if East holds BOTH the \SA and \SK. Or you could finesse the \ST, gaining a trick if East holds the \SJ. Obviously the second choice is more likely.

Having won the first \H trick in your hand, play a small \S and finesse the \ST. Suppose West wins the \SK and returns a \H. Take your \HA and play another \S, going up with the \SQ if East plays low. If the \SQ wins, take your 9 tricks and run.

Whenever the \SA and \SK are in different hands, the only thing that matters is the location of the \SJ. 

So it is basically a 50% chance.}

{West is to play 3NT. North leads the \HQ.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=1  \C=3  Total = 7

You need two more winners and \Ds is your longest combined suit. But you can only establish one extra winner in \Ds, and before you could even do that the defenders would have taken a bunch of \H tricks.

So you must turn to the \Ss for the extra two winners.

You win the first \H and lead . . . which \S? If you play the \SQ you will go down, even if North has the \SK. He would cover and you would be held to just 2 \S tricks.

The only way to get 3 tricks from this holding is to play South for the \SK. So play a \S to dummy's \SA and then a small \S back toward your \S Q J. Here South puts the \SK on and you are home-free.

If it had not dropped you would just have played a third round of \Ss, hoping for a 3-3 split in the suit.

again.

West follows once, then discards a \S and a \H.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=3  \D=2  \C=2  Total = 8

There are two possibilities for getting an extra winner. If the \Ds are splitting 3-3 you could play \DA, \DK and another \D and establish the thirteenth \D as a winner. Or you could play West for the \SK and lead toward your \SQ.

The chance of West holding the \SK is a little greater than 50%. (it is higher than the usual 50% because we know he started with only one \C, giving him more spaces for other cards).

The chance of \Ds splitting 3-3 is about 40%.

So you should enter dummy with a \H and play a small \S toward your \SQ.

Did it work?  to see. 

The problem is that you might run into this very distribution. You would establish a \D for West and when you played a \S from dummy West would jump up with the \SK and cash his winning \D for down 1.}

{East is to play 3NT. South leads the \DK.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=1  \C=4  Total = 8

You only need one more winner. If North has the \SK or the \HQ a simple finesse will give you the trick.

There are two problems though. The first one is that if South gets in he may take too many \D tricks. But the bigger problem is that North cannot possibly have either of those two high cards. You and dummy together hold 28 HCP and South must surely hold the other 12 since he opened the bidding. Neither simple finesse will work so you must try what is called a Backward Finesse.

Hold up the \DA until the third round to confirm that North has only 2. He does. Then play four rounds of \Cs ending in your hand.

Now play the \HJ. If South doesn't cover, you will let it ride for your ninth trick. But South does cover so you must take dummy's \HA. Next play a small \H from dummy and finesse the \H9, hoping North has the \HT. This is the Backward Finesse.

for the complete Deal to see if it worked. 

Like this time.

By the way. Those of you with great short-term memories might think they have seen this hand before. Well, you ALMOST have. Deal 8 has an almost identical layout but a much simpler theme. Check it out.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \S5, East plays the \SQ.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=2  \C=3  Total = 8

Before worrying about where that one winner is going to come from you need to decide what to do with the opening lead. A good guideline is to hold up unless you fear a switch. Here, with all other suits well protected you would welcome a switch, so you let East win the \SQ. East then plays the \S8. Do you hold up again?

It probably doesn't matter, but since you cannot possibly win more than T tricks you might just as well hold up again. West wins the \SJ then plays the \S3. East discards a \H on the third \S.

OK, now it is time to figure out where that extra trick is coming from. Not much figuring is needed, it must come from the \D suit. Since you are missing 5 cards including the Queen, the odds favor a finesse over playing for the drop. And, since you have the option of finessing either defender are you going to finesse into the one who can set you or into the safe one?

Silly question. Of course you play the \DK from your hand, then a small \D finessing dummy's \DT, which wins the trick - and the game - and the overtrick.

But in a situation like this you don't play odds. By finessing West you guaranteed making the contract even if the finesse lost because East had no more \Ss. Even a losing \D finesse would have established the one trick you needed.}

{West is to play 6\S after East's Stayman bid. North leads the \HQ.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=1  \D=0  \C=1  Total = 2

This looks like a very simple plan. Since the hands have mirrored distribution there will be no discards anywhere. That means the \CK MUST be in North's hand or you will go down. But is that all there is to it?

If North has \C K x or \C K x x then yes, that's all there is to it. But if he has \C K x x x then you won't have enough entries to your hand unless you take the first \C finesse BEFORE you start on trumps.

So win the \HA and immediately play a \C to dummy's \CJ, which holds the trick. Then pull trumps, (it takes 4 rounds), ending in your hand.

Next play your \CT, putting on the \C5 from dummy when North plays low again. This lets you stay in your hand to play another \C to the \CQ, picking up all four \C tricks and the slam.

But also you had to play to one of dummy's honors first so you could retain that \C5 for letting you stay in your hand to make the third finesse. Bridge is great.}
