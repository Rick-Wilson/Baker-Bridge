{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \H3.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=2  \C=4  Total = 8

First things first. Win the first \H, do not hold up. East's \H3 indicates he has led a 4-card suit so a hold-up wouldn't help you. And if you did hold up they might pocket their \H trick and switch to \Ds, a suit you are no better off in.

You need to get one more winner and it will have to be a \S winner. You could lead toward the \SQ, winning a trick if East holds BOTH the \SA and \SK. Or you could finesse the \ST, gaining a trick if East holds the \SJ. Obviously the second choice is more likely.

Having won the first \H trick in your hand, play a small \S and finesse the \ST. Suppose West wins the \SK and returns a \H. Take your \HA and play another \S, going up with the \SQ if East plays low. If the \SQ wins, take your 9 tricks and run.

Whenever the \SA and \SK are in different hands, the only thing that matters is the location of the \SJ. 

So it is basically a 50% chance.}

{East is to play 4\S. South leads the \D2. The defenders win 3 \D tricks, then play a \C.

Losers:   \S = 0 or 1    \H = 0  \D = 3    \C = 0 Total = 3 or 4

Since you have already lost 3 \D tricks you cannot also lose a \S trick. That means North will have to have the \SK and it also means that you will have to be careful with your finessing.

In your hand with a \C you play over to dummy's \HA. Now lead the \SQ from dummy and when North plays low play the \SJ (or T) from your hand.

The \SQ held the trick so you are still in dummy. Play the \S9, and when North doesn't cover, play your \S8 under it. South shows out on this trick and you are glad you played so carefully. Play one more \S, finessing North's \SK again, then play your \SA and the rest of your winners.

True, the chances of North holding 4 \Ss to the King are pretty small, but it costs you nothing to protect yourself against that holding. 

And the rewards are great.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \H7. East takes the \HA and returns the \H2.

Winners:   \S=3  \H=1  \D=3  \C=1  Total = 8

You need one more winner and \Cs is your best suit. If the \CK is in West's hand you can finesse it for 12 tricks. But if the \CK is in East's hand you will lose that trick and at least 4 \Hs.

Before you put all your eggs in the \C finesse basket there is one thing you should do first.

You should test the \D suit by playing \DQ, \DK, \DA. Both defenders follow three times and your \D6 has become a winner, which you cash.

Now you have a problem. You have won 5 tricks so far and you have 4 more winners ready to take. So you can take your 9 tricks and run, or you can finesse the \C trying for 3 overtricks.<br><br>It's your decision, but  to see how your decision would have turned out.</br></br> 

But at Match Point Pairs the reward would be much greater, a probable very high board. Of course with this layout it might have gotten you a bottom board.}

{West is to play 3NT. North leads the \HQ.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=1  \C=3  Total = 7

You need two more winners and \Ds is your longest combined suit. But you can only establish one extra winner in \Ds, and before you could even do that the defenders would have taken a bunch of \H tricks.

So you must turn to the \Ss for the extra two winners.

You win the first \H and lead . . . which \S? If you play the \SQ you will go down, even if North has the \SK. He would cover and you would be held to just 2 \S tricks.

The only way to get 3 tricks from this holding is to play South for the \SK. So play a \S to dummy's \SA and then a small \S back toward your \S Q J. Here South puts the \SK on and you are home-free.

If it had not dropped you would just have played a third round of \Ss, hoping for a 3-3 split in the suit.

again.
