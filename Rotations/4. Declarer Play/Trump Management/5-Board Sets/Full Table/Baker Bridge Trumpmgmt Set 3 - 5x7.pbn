{North is to play 4\H. East leads the \SK, taken by dummy's \SA.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=0  \D=1  \C=3  Total = 4

One possibility is to pull trumps and play for a 3-3 \D split. This will occur about 36% of the time. While you may not know all the bridge probabilities, it is useful to remember that an EVEN number of cards (6 in this case) will probably NOT split EVENLY (3-3 in this case). So, let's try to improve on 36%.

You could play to pull just two rounds of trumps, then ruff your fourth \D, hoping that the defender with the third trump also has the fourth \D. These odds are tougher to figure, but it doesn't look good, does it?

If you don't see a better Plan than these two, just put yourself in Dummy's seat and pretend you are playing 4\H from that side of the table. 

Aha! From dummy's viewpoint you have no \D losers! You still have the 3 \C losers, but now you also have 3 \S losers. How does this help you?

You can now ruff all 3 of those \S losers in the North hand. Like this:Win the \SA and ruff a \S with the \HA. Play a small \H to dummy's \H9. Ruff another \S with the \HK. Play a small \H to dummy's \HT. Ruff dummy's last \S with your last trump, the \HJ. Enter dummy with a \D and pull the last trump with the \HQ.

You win 3 \Ds, 3 \Hs in dummy, the \SA and 3 \S ruffs in your hand. Total: T tricks.

For a Dummy Reversal to work you usually have to have a decent trump split.}

{East is to play 4\H. South leads the \DK.

Losers:   \S=2  \H=1  \D=0  \C=1  Total = 4

You could go to dummy with the \SA and try a finesse for the \CK. If it works, no more \C loser. But if it fails the bad guys will cash a couple of \Ss and even you can't dodge the Ace of trumps.

Or, you could try to get to dummy with a trump to the \HJ so you could make the \C finesse while dummy still keeps the \SA. Of course the defenders would probably take the first \H and then knock out your \SA. When the \C finesse failed, same bad result. What else might you try? 

Forget the \C finesse. Forget pulling trumps. Win the first trick and play any \C from your hand. Let's say you play the \CJ. A defender wins the \CK and attacks \Ss. Too late, you are in the driver's seat. Win the \SA, play a \C to your \CQ, and then play the \CA, discarding a \S from dummy. You lose the Ace of trumps, one \C, and just one \S.

Trying to sneak into dummy with a trump might have worked.

Playing a \C from your hand at the second trick WILL work.}

{South is to play 4\H. West leads the \CK which you win with dummy's \CA.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=1  \D=2  \C=1  Total = 4

You could come to your hand with the \DA and finesse West for the \HK. The problem with this idea is that even if the finesse works the \HK probably wouldn't drop.  

A better idea is to stay away from trumps until you ruff a \D loser in dummy. So you play the \DK and everybody follows with small cards. Then play the \D8, covered by East's \DJ, taken by your \DA.

Next play your \D3. East plays the \DQ and you do what? 

You ruff of course, that was the whole point of playing \Ds before trumps. But which card will you ruff with? Suppose you ruff with the \H5 and East follows with another \D. You could then play \SA and ruff a \S to get to your hand, then ruff your last \D with dummy's \HA. You would lose only the trump King and one \C, making an overtrick.

Any problem with that? Yes, a big problem. East might be out of \Ds also. If you ruff with dummy's \H5 East may overruff, then play a trump and you would not get any \D ruffs. Since you only need to ruff one \D in dummy to make the contract, it is safer to ruff with the \HA. You will end up losing 1 \C, 1\D and the trump King.

Did you notice that West is a pretty good defender? Playing the \DQ on the third round just might have convinced you that he was short in \Ds, in which case ruffing with the low trump would have been safe.}

{West is to play 4\S. North leads the \HA, then the \HK, then \HT.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=0  \C=2  Total = 4

The 2 \Hs are already lost, so you put your mind to the 2 \Cs. If the suit splits 3-3 the problem goes away, but a 4-2 split is more likely. So you should plan to ruff the fourth \C in dummy.   

Ruff the third \H. Then play \C A K 3. North discards a \H on the third \C which South wins. South will probably return his last \C at this point, hoping North can ruff higher than dummy's \S9. But he cannot, so you ruff in dummy, pull trumps and claim the rest.

But, it was a good plan because dummy held the \S9. Keep that in mind when you look at Deal 15.}

{This is identical to Deal 14 except dummy has the \S4 in place of the \S9. North is to play 4\S. East leads the \HA, then the \HK, then \HT.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=0  \C=2  Total = 4

The 2 \Hs are already lost, so you put your mind to the 2 \Cs. If the suit splits 3-3 the problem goes away, but a 4-2 split is more likely. So you should plan to ruff the fourth \C in dummy.   

You cannot use the same method that worked in Deal 14 because with this hand when you ruffed the fourth \C with dummy's \S4 it would surely get over-ruffed. This time you are going to have to be very lucky and find the defender with only two \Cs to also have only two \Ss.

Suppose you ruff the third \H, pull just two rounds of trumps, then play \C A K 3. No good. The defender with the \Cs will take that trick and play his last trump, stopping dummy from the \C ruff.

But this way will work. Ruff the third \H and duck a \C! Win any return and now pull two rounds of trumps. Then play \C A K 6, ruffing the \C6 with dummy's last trump. The rest of the tricks are yours.

But you also had to be extremely clever to pull it off. This is probably the hardest Deal in this section.}
