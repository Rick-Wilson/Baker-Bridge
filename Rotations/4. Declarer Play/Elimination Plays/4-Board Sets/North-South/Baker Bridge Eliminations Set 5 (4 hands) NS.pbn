{When the bidding gets high in a hurry you sometimes have to guess what you can make. North plays 4\S. East leads the \HK.

And it looks like you are too high. Assuming the trumps split 2-1, you still have one \H loser, two \D losers and one \C loser.

You win the \HA and play a \S to your \SK. West discards a \D! 

From bad to worse. Now you must add a \S loser to the four you already had. Are you finished?

No, never give up. East has a bunch of \Hs and 3 \Ss, so he cannot have many \Ds and \Cs. If you can eliminate those and then throw him in it should work to your advantage.

Play your \SA, the \DA and the \C A K. East follows to everything.

You've done all you can do. Now play the \HT to East's high \H. 

East has just won his side's first trick with the \HJ. He now plays the \SQ, winning his side's second trick.

Now, East is still on lead, and he has nothing in his hand but good \Hs. So he leads one of them, and you DO NOT RUFF. Instead you discard a \C from dummy and a \D from your own hand. East has now taken his side's third trick. He plays another good \H, and you ruff in dummy and discard the last \D loser from your hand. You can now cross-ruff for the rest of the tricks.

You just wonder how many bridge players would have just conceded down 2 on this hand.

Not you or me, of course.}

{North's 3\S is a limit raise, 11-12 points in support of \Ss. When you discover that the raise includes two Aces you bid the slam. South plays 6\S. West leads the \DK, won by you with dummy's \DA.

So rather than finesse, eliminate! Pull trumps in two rounds, ending in dummy.

Ruff the \D6, then play \CA, \CK, \CQ.

So here you are in dummy. Do you finesse the \H now? Of course not. You play the \DJ and discard a small \H from your hand. West wins his \DQ (which his opening lead told you he held) and is end-played. He must lead a \H to your tenace or give you a ruff-sluff.

It is a pretty simple problem, but you are no doubt getting a lot better.}

{South realizes that to make a takeout double, then jump in your own suit you must have a very good hand. So he bids the game. North plays 4\H. East leads the \CK, which you take with the \CA.

Play one round of trumps with the \HA. You can't play any more because you will need an entry to dummy for the elimination.

Next play \SK, \SA and ruff a \S high.

Lead a \H to dummy's \HQ. East shows out. Play dummy's last \S. West is now void, so if he ruffs you over-ruff. Otherwise you ruff with a small trump.

Now throw East in (you hope!) with the \CT.

Fortunately East has to take the \CT. Since he has nothing left but \Cs and \Ds he must lead one or the other. A \D lead will give you a trick with your \DK and a \C lead will allow you to ruff in dummy (West still has a \C) and discard a \D from your hand.

It was not a complete elimination since West still had a trump when you threw East in. However, it worked because East was out of both \Ss and \Hs.}

{South is to play 4\S. West leads the \DQ.  

The contract is in danger if East holds the \CA because you would have three \C losers to go with the \D already lost. One really good possibility is that East now has the lone \DA and you can set up dummy's \DK with a ruff.

So play a small \S to dummy's \S9, (pulling the two outstanding trumps), and ruff another \D with an honor, hoping the \DA drops.

Too bad, the \DA did not fall so dummy's \DK is not a winner. But it will still prove to be useful. 

Play the \HA, then ruff a \H in dummy. Play a trump to your \SA and ruff your last \H.

You are in dummy, just where you want to be. Play the \DK, and when East plays the \DA don't ruff but instead discard a \C from your hand. You knew all along that he held the \DA.

East is end-played, forced to either break the \Cs and give you a \C trick, or give you a ruff-sluff.

It also depended upon the defenders not switching to \Cs at the second trick. If West had decided to switch to the \CQ you would have had no chance at all. }
