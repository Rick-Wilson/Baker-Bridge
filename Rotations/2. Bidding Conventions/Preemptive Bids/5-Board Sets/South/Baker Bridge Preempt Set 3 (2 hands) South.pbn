{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

The fact that East opened doesn't change your hand at all. You had planned on Opening 3\S, now you make a Weak Jump Overcall of 3\S. If partner has some "stuff" you might get to a makeable contract, and if he doesn't you may keep the opponents out of a \H game.

This time everybody passes.}

You have four quick winners. If partner had opened 3\H you would have bid 4\H in the blink of an eye. His Weak Jump Overcall describes the exact same hand. So blink and bid 4\H.}
