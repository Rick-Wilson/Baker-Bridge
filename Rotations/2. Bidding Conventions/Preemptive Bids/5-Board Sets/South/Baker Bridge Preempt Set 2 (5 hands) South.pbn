{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

If is hard to imagine any hand partner could have where the slam wouldn't be there. Maybe you should use Blackwood, just to be sure? If partner shows 1 Ace you would then bid 6\S. And if he shows no Aces you would then . . . bid 6\S anyway. So you leave out the middle step and bid 6\S.

Did you think about bidding 6NT instead? Ugh, they would have led a \C.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You make a simple 3\H opening bid and then the fireworks start. North doubles, your partner passes and South bids 3\S.  

Do not preempt the same hand twice. The idea of a preemptive bid is that you bid it's maximum at your first turn. If there is to any further competing on this hand partner will have to do it.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You do not have the 4 fast winners you need to raise partner to the 4-level. But you do have 4 of his trumps and 2 and a half winners. And your side doesn't have much defense against a 3\S contract. You should raise partner to 4\D because you think they can make 3\S. With these hands it appears they might have gone to 4\S in which case you would have had to decide whether to continue to 5\D. More judgement would be called for,based on Vulnerability, whether you think they can make the game, etc. The Law of Total Tricks can be a help in these competitive situations; it would lead you to 5\D.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You open 3\D. North doubles, partner raises to 4\D, and South bids 4\H. What do you say? 

You just pass. Partner's raise was probably just advancing your preempt and they got to 4\H anyway. Sometimes preempts don't do the full job.

It is partner's decision, not yours, whether to continue to 5\D as a sacrifice.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

The guidelines in the summary would have you bid 4\H. After all you very clearly have four quick winners.

But you also have seven quick losers in the other suits, and a trump void to boot.

Somewhere in some of these lessons there should be a guideline that says:
