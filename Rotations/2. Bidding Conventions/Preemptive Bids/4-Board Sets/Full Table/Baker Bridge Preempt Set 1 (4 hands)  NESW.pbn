{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have 13 points and if partner had opened with a 1\S bid you'd be feeling "jumpy". But what a preemptive bidder needs from dummy are immediate winners, not points. So you pass.

Here's a pretty good tip:When partner opens with a 3-bid and you are trying to decide whether to take him to game, visualize him holding this very hand:K Q J T x x x of trumps and nothing in any other suit. Then base your decision on that.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You expect your hand to produce 5 \H tricks and the \SA. So you open 3\H. Partner responds 4\H. What do you bid? 

When you preempted 3\H you described your hand perfectly. You have nothing more to say except pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

No matter how much we try to reduce bridge to rules and guidelines we will never get rid of the judgement factor. With this hand you definitely have 3 fast tricks for partner. In theory he can take 6 of his own, so 3\H should be the right contract. BUT, maybe he could ruff a \D in your dummy?

Fortune favors the bold so you bid 4\H . . . and live happily ever after.}
