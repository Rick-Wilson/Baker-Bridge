{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You open 3\D. North doubles, partner raises to 4\D, and South bids 4\H. What do you say? 

You just pass. Partner's raise was probably just advancing your preempt and they got to 4\H anyway. Sometimes preempts don't do the full job.

It is partner's decision, not yours, whether to continue to 5\D as a sacrifice.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

The guidelines in the summary would have you bid 4\H. After all you very clearly have four quick winners.

But you also have seven quick losers in the other suits, and a trump void to boot.

Somewhere in some of these lessons there should be a guideline that says:

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

The fact that East opened doesn't change your hand at all. You had planned on Opening 3\S, now you make a Weak Jump Overcall of 3\S. If partner has some "stuff" you might get to a makeable contract, and if he doesn't you may keep the opponents out of a \H game.

This time everybody passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have four quick winners. If partner had opened 3\H you would have bid 4\H in the blink of an eye. His Weak Jump Overcall describes the exact same hand. So blink and bid 4\H.}
