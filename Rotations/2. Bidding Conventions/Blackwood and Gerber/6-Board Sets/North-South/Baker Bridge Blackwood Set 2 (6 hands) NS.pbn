1D pass 2NT pass 4C pass 4S pass 6NT
[Result ""]
{You dealt this hand.  

You have 20 points and it would not be terrible to open 2NT. However, strictly speaking you shouldn't open 2NT with two doubletons. So you open 1\D. Partner responds with a jump to 2NT. What do you bid? 

With partner's 13-15 added onto your 20, bidding 6NT would be a reasonable bid. However, it costs nothing to check for Aces first, so you bid 4\C. (Everybody agrees this is Gerber, right?)Partner answers 4\S. What do you bid? 

Easy, missing one Ace you bid 6NT.}

[Result ""]
{You dealt this hand.  

With 13 points and a good Major suit you naturally open 1\S. Partner responds 3\H. What do you bid next? 

We are playing strong jump-shifts by Responder so partner is showing 17+ points. However, you are still stuck with your minimum opening so you just rebid 3\S. Partner bids 4NT. What is your reply? 

He asks for Aces so you bid 5\H showing 2. He now bids 5NT. What do you say? 

You have no King. So you reply 6\C and partner bids 6NT (safer than 6\S).}

{You need to find out about Aces so you bid 4NT. Partner says 6\D. What do you bid? 

Partner has shown one Ace and a \D void. As to what you bid, that's easy. You have no choice now but to say 6\H. This is a pretty good slam, but it is not cold. Maybe East will not lead a \C. Or maybe West will have the \DA.}

{Not everybody responds to 2\C openers the same way. But with 9 balanced points 2NT is reasonable. Partner jumps to 4\C. What do you bid? 

With 2 Aces your response is 4\S. Partner bids 6NT and you pass.}

[Result ""]
{Interesting hand. Too bad these only come up in lessons and never at the table! You could jump right into Ace-asking but there is no rush so you say 2\S. Partner now rebids 2NT. What do you say? 

Now you know all about partner's hand. 22-24 points, balanced. Now ask for Aces. If you agree that 4\C is Gerber here then that's what you should bid. If not, then you would have to use Blackwood. Partner answers 4\D. What do you say? 

The 4\D reply says either zero or all four. Put your money on all four and bid 7NT.}

[Result ""]
{With 15 points and a nice 5-card suit you respond 1\S. Partner jumps to 4\S. What do you say? 

Do NOT say "Partner bid a close-out bid so I'll pass." Partner's bid means he thinks you can make 4\S even though he is only counting you for 6 points. Since you have 15+ now you want to go for more. You bid 4NT and partner answers 5\D. What do you say next? 

Partner has 1 Ace so you can go no higher than 6. Although you can't tell for sure that slam will make, remember you used Blackwood just to be sure you weren't missing two Aces. You are not and you have enough points so you bid it. Although you can see that 6NT would have been a great contract you had to take the safer 6\S.}
