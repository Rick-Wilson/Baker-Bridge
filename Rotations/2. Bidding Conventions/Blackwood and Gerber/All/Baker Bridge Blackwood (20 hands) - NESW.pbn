Wouldn't it have been funny if partner had thought your 4\C bid was Stayman? And so his 4\H bid would have been showing a suit. And then your 4NT bid would have been Blackwood. And then he would have answered 5\D and you would have passed and made it!}

You have no King. So you reply 6\C and partner bids 6NT (safer than 6\S).}

Do NOT say "Partner bid a close-out bid so I'll pass." Partner's bid means he thinks you can make 4\S even though he is only counting you for 6 points. Since you have 15+ now you want to go for more. You bid 4NT and partner answers 5\D. What do you say next? 

Partner has 1 Ace so you can go no higher than 6. Although you can't tell for sure that slam will make, remember you used Blackwood just to be sure you weren't missing two Aces. You are not and you have enough points so you bid it. Although you can see that 6NT would have been a great contract you had to take the safer 6\S.}

Partner's limit-raise shows 11-12 points and you revalue your hand up to 22. So you are definitely in slam territory. You hope partner has 2 Aces but you cannot use Blackwood with that worthless doubleton in \Ds. Instead you make a control-showing bid of 4\C. Partner then bids 4\H. What do you bid next? 

The good news is that partner's control-showing bid says he has the \HA. The bad news is that he bypassed \Ds so he does not have the \DA. Since you may have 2 quick losers in \Ds you sign off at 4\S. }
