{You need to find out about Aces so you bid 4NT. Partner says 6\D. What do you bid? 

Partner has shown one Ace and a \D void. As to what you bid, that's easy. You have no choice now but to say 6\H. This is a pretty good slam, but it is not cold. Maybe West will not lead a \C. Or maybe East will have the \DA.}

{Not everybody responds to 2\C openers the same way. But with 9 balanced points 2NT is reasonable. Partner jumps to 4\C. What do you bid? 

With 2 Aces your response is 4\S. Partner bids 6NT and you pass.}

[Result ""]
{Interesting hand. Too bad these only come up in lessons and never at the table! You could jump right into Ace-asking but there is no rush so you say 2\S. Partner now rebids 2NT. What do you say? 

Now you know all about partner's hand. 22-24 points, balanced. Now ask for Aces. If you agree that 4\C is Gerber here then that's what you should bid. If not, then you would have to use Blackwood. Partner answers 4\D. What do you say? 

The 4\D reply says either zero or all four. Put your money on all four and bid 7NT.}

1C pass 1S pass 4S pass 4NT pass 5D pass 6S pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{With 15 points and a nice 5-card suit you respond 1\S. Partner jumps to 4\S. What do you say? 

Do NOT say "Partner bid a close-out bid so I'll pass." Partner's bid means he thinks you can make 4\S even though he is only counting you for 6 points. Since you have 15+ now you want to go for more. You bid 4NT and partner answers 5\D. What do you say next? 

Partner has 1 Ace so you can go no higher than 6. Although you can't tell for sure that slam will make, remember you used Blackwood just to be sure you weren't missing two Aces. You are not and you have enough points so you bid it. Although you can see that 6NT would have been a great contract you had to take the safer 6\S.}
