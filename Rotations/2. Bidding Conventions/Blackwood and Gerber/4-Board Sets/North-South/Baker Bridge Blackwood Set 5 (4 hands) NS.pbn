[Result ""]
{After toying with the idea of a jump to 6NT, or perhaps a Gerber 4\C, you decide to bid 3\D. Partner rebids 4\D and it is your turn. 

Time to check for Aces. You bid 4NT and partner answers 5\H. What do you bid? 

Tempting though it may be it is too dangerous to try 6NT. So you bid 6\D which turns out to be laydown while 6NT would have been down 4.}

{You dealt this hand.  

You decide to preempt 3\S with this hand. Partner's eyes wobble and he jumps straight to 4NT. What do you bid? 

With 1 Ace and a void in a lower-ranking suit you should bid 6 of that suit. So you bid 6\C. Partner jumps again, this time to 7\S. What do you b . . . oh never mind.}

2NT pass 4C pass 4H pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{If you play Jacoby Transfers you may think of transferring partner to \Hs, then bidding the slam. but with this hand there really is no big advantage for partner being the Declarer so you decide to just take the bull by the horns. You bid a Gerber 4\C. Partner says 4\H. What do you bid? 

Partner has only a single Ace in his 2NT opener. No slam for your team. You pass and let partner be the Declarer after all!}

[Result ""]
{Your 4\C bid is a Splinter Bid, showing an opening hand with good \H support and either a singleton or a void in \Cs. Decide what you would reply to partner's 4NT, then  on BID above. 

With 2 Aces and a void the correct response is 5NT. Partner now bids 7\H. Notice how he cleverly figured out your void must be in \Cs.}
