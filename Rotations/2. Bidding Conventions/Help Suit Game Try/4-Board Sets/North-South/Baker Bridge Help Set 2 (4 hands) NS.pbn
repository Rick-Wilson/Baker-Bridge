{Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

You are almost strong enough to bid the game right now, but you are worried about \Cs. If partner can Help out in that suit you'd be willing to try for T tricks. So you make a Help Suit Game Try of 3\C. Partner replies 3\H. What do you say next?  

When you ask partner to make a judgement call and he does so, you don't then override that call. You pass.}

Partner is worried about his \H losers and you can certainly take care of some of them. So even though you only have 6 HCP you bid 4\S.}

{Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

You have an invitational strength hand, but there are TWO suits you could use some help in. In this case you pick the suit where the Help would be most welcome. If partner can Help in \Ds that will probably be all you need to make game.

So you bid 3\D and partner puts you right to 4\S.}

{Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

Partner has invited you to bid game and you have 10 points, an absolute maximum. But, he has also told you he is worried about \Cs and your help in that suit is rather nebulous.

Since you have to make a judgement one way or the other you should decide that a Queen is a little bit of Help and with the 10 points that should be enough. You bid 4\H.}
