{Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

There is no doubt that you could use some help in \Ds. But you need more than that, you need points. This hand isn't good enough to invite to game so you pass.}

This is not a great hand by any means. If partner had invited with a 3\S bid you might have passed. But he invited with a 3\H bid, asking if you can Help him take care of losers in that suit. And you have loads of Help. Not only do you have a high honor but you can ruff the third round. So you bid 4\S.}

{Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

You might make a Help Suit Game Try in \Cs, but with 19/20 points in your own hand you should just bid the game yourself. So you bid 4\S.}

Partner is inviting you to bid game, and your 8 points are right in the "judgement" area.

But he has asked you to use judgement based on your \D holding, which is awful. So you sign off at 3\H. }
