{You respond 2\C. Partner rebids 2\D. What is your next bid? 

With 13 HCP and that \C suit you could jump to 4\C. However, that would sail you right past 3NT which is very likely to turn out your best game. Rather than rebid \Cs, find out whether partner has \Ss stopped by using FSF.

You bid 2\S and partner then says 2NT. Where do you go from here? 

It couldn't have worked out better. Notrump played from partner's side. You bid 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{You are the dealer.  

There is only one possibility; you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\D.  

You rebid "up-the-line", so you now say 1\H. Partner says 1\S. What do you bid? 

Be careful! This is NOT Fourth Suit Forcing. It is true that you are forced to bid, but the difference is that in this sequence partner has a real \S suit. With 4-card support you bid 2\S and partner raises to 4\S.}

{You have 13 points and you respond 1\S. Partner rebids 2\C. What is your next bid? 

You have \Ds stopped, and with your 13 points you might well jump to 3NT. And while you may end up at 3NT it can't hurt to find out if partner has 3 \Ss first. So you bid 2\D, FSF. 

Partner says 2\S, telling you he has three of them, and you bid 4\S.}

{You are the dealer.  

You have 15 points and you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\H.  

Show your 4-card Major, bid 1\S. Partner says 2\D.  

This is FSF, asking you to further describe your hand. Since you have 3 \Hs you will naturally let partner know that. But, your hand is so good you should jump to 3\H. Remember that partner may be bidding with only 12 points.

He was pretty weak, but with your jump finds enough to say 4\H.}
