{You show your 4-card Major. Bid 1\S. Partner rebids 2\C. What do you say next? 

You have a nice \D suit but don't bid it now. That would be FSF and partner would assume you didn't have a \D stopper. 

With 13 points, bid what you expect to make, 3NT. Partner passes.}

{You are the dealer.  

You open 1\H. As expected, partner responds 1\S.  

This is easy bidding so far. You bid your second 5-card suit, 2\C.

Partner says 2\D. What do you bid? 

Partner's bid is FSF. He wants to know if you have 3 \Ss, (you don't), or if you can stop \Ds, (you can't). So you have to rebid one of your 5-carders, and you should bid the lower-ranking one. You bid 3\C and partner raises to 5\C.}

{You have 15 points and you respond 1\S. Partner rebids 2\D. What do you say next? 

You would love to play 4\S if partner has 3 \Ss. Or, you would love partner to play 3NT if he has \Cs stopped.

So you say 3\C (FSF) to find out if either possibility exists. Partner does have \Cs stopped and bids 3NT.}

{You are the dealer.  

With both 4-card minors you open 1\D. Partner responds 1\S. What do you bid next? 

You cannot bid 2\H since you are not strong enough to reverse, so you bid 2\C.

Partner jumps to 3\H. What do you bid? 

Since partner jumped this is NOT FSF. Partner has a \H suit and a pretty good hand to go with it. You also have a \H suit so you bid 4\H.}
