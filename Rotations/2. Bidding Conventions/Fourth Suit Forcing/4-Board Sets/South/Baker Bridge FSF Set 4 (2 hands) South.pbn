{You have 13 points and you respond 1\S. Partner rebids 2\C. What is your next bid? 

You have \Ds stopped, and with your 13 points you might well jump to 3NT. And while you may end up at 3NT it can't hurt to find out if partner has 3 \Ss first. So you bid 2\D, FSF. 

Partner says 2\S, telling you he has three of them, and you bid 4\S.}

[Result ""]
{You are the dealer.  

You have 15 points and you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\H.  

Show your 4-card Major, bid 1\S. Partner says 2\D.  

This is FSF, asking you to further describe your hand. Since you have 3 \Hs you will naturally let partner know that. But, your hand is so good you should jump to 3\H. Remember that partner may be bidding with only 12 points.

He was pretty weak, but with your jump finds enough to say 4\H.}
