{With 14 points you will insist on game, but you aren't strong enough to jump shift. So you bid 1\H. Partner rebids 1\S.  

Partner shows nothing extra. All you know now is that he doesn't have 4 \Hs. You know you want to be in game, but you aren't sure which game. If partner has 3 \Hs then 4\H would be good. If not though, 3NT would be good if he has a \D stopper. The way to find out what he has is with Fourth Suit Forcing. So you bid 2\D. Partner answers with 2\H.  

Partner tells you he has 3 \Hs. You bid the \H game.}

{You are the dealer.  

With 13 points you open 1\D. Partner responds 1\H.  

Partner might be 4-4 in the Majors so you bid 1\S. Apparently he wasn't since he says 2\C.  

This is Fourth Suit Forcing and partner may or may not have a \C suit. You do not have 3 \Hs. You do have a \C stopper, so with a minimum hand you bid 2NT and partner passes.}

{You are the dealer.  

You open your 5-card suit, 1\D. Partner responds 1\S.  

You might bid 1NT, but since you have a singleton you prefer to say 2\C.

Partner bids 2\H. What do you say? 

This is Fourth Suit Forcing and partner is fishing for more information. You certainly don't have 3 of his \Ss so that is out. On the other hand, you have a double stopper in \Hs, so with 14 points you go right to 3NT.}

{You show your 4-card Major. Bid 1\S. Partner rebids 2\C. What do you say next? 

You have a nice \D suit but don't bid it now. That would be FSF and partner would assume you didn't have a \D stopper. 

With 13 points, bid what you expect to make, 3NT. Partner passes.}

{You are the dealer.  

You open 1\H. As expected, partner responds 1\S.  

This is easy bidding so far. You bid your second 5-card suit, 2\C.

Partner says 2\D. What do you bid? 

Partner's bid is FSF. He wants to know if you have 3 \Ss, (you don't), or if you can stop \Ds, (you can't). So you have to rebid one of your 5-carders, and you should bid the lower-ranking one. You bid 3\C and partner raises to 5\C.}
