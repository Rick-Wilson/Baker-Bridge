Partner's 3\C bid shows a weak hand and a poor suit. So you reluctantly settle for 3\H.}

{You could just guess between pass, 3NT, or 5\D.

But you use Ogust instead. Partner responds 3\D. What do you bid next? 

Partner's 3\D bid shows a minimum hand but a good suit, which should mean two of the top three honors. Your \DK tells you that partner has a 6-card \D  suit headed by the A Q. With three outside Aces you can count 9 tricks - you bid 3NT.}

{This is a perfect hand for Ogust - when you're not sure what to do! So you bid 2NT. Partner responds 3NT. What do you bid next? 

Partner's 3NT bid describes his hand exactly; \H A K Q x x x and nothing else. You MIGHT have a \S stopper, but they might be arranged so the defenders could take the first 5 \S tricks. So you bid the "safe" 4\H game which depends only on a 3-2 trump split.}

[Result ""]
{Before you read this lesson you might have just jumped to a Blackwood 4NT. But now you bid an Ogust 2NT. Partner rebids 3\S. What do you bid next? 

Wow! Partner has a maximum Weak 2-bid and a good trump suit, no doubt headed by the A Q.  If he also has the \HA you might be cold for 7\S. Bid Blackwood if you must, but you don't really need to since partner could not possibly have The \HA AND \S A Q x x x x. Too many points for a Weak 2-bid. So you bid 6\S.}
