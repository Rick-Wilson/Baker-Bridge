{Before you read this lesson you might have just jumped to a Blackwood 4NT. But now you bid an Ogust 2NT. Partner rebids 3\S. What do you bid next? 

Wow! Partner has a maximum Weak 2-bid and a good trump suit, no doubt headed by the A Q.  If he also has the \HA you might be cold for 7\S. Bid Blackwood if you must, but you don't really need to since partner could not possibly have The \HA AND \S A Q x x x x. Too many points for a Weak 2-bid. So you bid 6\S.}
