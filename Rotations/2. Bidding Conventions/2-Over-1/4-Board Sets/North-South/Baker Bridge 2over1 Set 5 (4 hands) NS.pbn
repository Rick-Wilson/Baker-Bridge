{North opens 1\H. South responds 1NT, just as in standard bidding. The difference is that in this case the 1NT response is forcing on North.

North has an easy second bid, he rebids his 6-card suit. South has nothing to say over 2\H except pass.

Notice that this is the same bidding and same final contract that would have been reached with standard bidding. Using 2/1 is often like that.}

{South opens 1\S. North responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

South cannot rebid her \Ss, but has decent support for partner's \Ds. So she bids 3\D.

North always intended to play a \S contract. He now bids 4\S, using Fast Arrival to indicate he has no slam aspirations.

4\S is cold, and if the defenders don't take their \H tricks immediately South will make an overtrick.}

[Result ""]
{South opens 1\H and West Doubles.

After the intervening Takeout Double 2/1 is OFF. If North had T or more points she would Redouble. So even with only 9 points North can bid 2\C without fear that South will think she has a strong hand.

South also knows everything mentioned above so he passes.}

[Result ""]
{South opens 1\S. North responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

South has a big hand, perhaps in the slam range, but first priority is to set a trump suit. So she contents herself with a rebid of 2\S.  North agrees on trumps by bidding 3\S (not Fast Arrival).

South now makes her slam try by using a Control-showing cue-bid. She bids 4\C, showing first round control of the suit (Ace or Void).

North's next bid would be a control-showing bid of her own - IF SHE HAD ONE. Since she cannot win the first round of either red suit she just returns to 4\S. South realizes that they are off two red Aces and passes.

Notice that South did not fall into the Blackwood trap. If she HAD asked for Aces, North would have shown one Ace and South wouldn't know what to do next. She might have figured the odds favored that one Ace being a red one and tried the slam. Moral: Don't use Blackwood when you have a void.}
