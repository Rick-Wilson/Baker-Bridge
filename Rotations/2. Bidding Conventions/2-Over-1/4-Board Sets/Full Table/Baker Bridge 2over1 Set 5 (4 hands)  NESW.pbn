{North opens 1\H. South responds 1NT, just as in standard bidding. The difference is that in this case the 1NT response is forcing on North.

North has an easy second bid, he rebids his 6-card suit. South has nothing to say over 2\H except pass.

Notice that this is the same bidding and same final contract that would have been reached with standard bidding. Using 2/1 is often like that.}

{East opens 1\S. West responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

East cannot rebid her \Ss, but has decent support for partner's \Ds. So she bids 3\D.

West always intended to play a \S contract. He now bids 4\S, using Fast Arrival to indicate he has no slam aspirations.

4\S is cold, and if the defenders don't take their \H tricks immediately East will make an overtrick.}

[Result ""]
{North opens 1\H and East Doubles.

After the intervening Takeout Double 2/1 is OFF. If South had T or more points she would Redouble. So even with only 9 points South can bid 2\C without fear that North will think she has a strong hand.

North also knows everything mentioned above so he passes.}

[Result ""]
{West opens 1\S. East responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

West has a big hand, perhaps in the slam range, but first priority is to set a trump suit. So she contents herself with a rebid of 2\S.  East agrees on trumps by bidding 3\S (not Fast Arrival).

West now makes her slam try by using a Control-showing cue-bid. She bids 4\C, showing first round control of the suit (Ace or Void).

East's next bid would be a control-showing bid of her own - IF SHE HAD ONE. Since she cannot win the first round of either red suit she just returns to 4\S. West realizes that they are off two red Aces and passes.

Notice that West did not fall into the Blackwood trap. If she HAD asked for Aces, East would have shown one Ace and West wouldn't know what to do next. She might have figured the odds favored that one Ace being a red one and tried the slam. Moral: Don't use Blackwood when you have a void.}
