{North opens 1\S. With 11 points South cannot respond 2\C. So she bids 1NT, which is forcing for 1 round. 

North's first priority is to show a 4-card \H suit. Since he doesn't have one his next priority is to rebid the 6-card \Ss.

South is strong enough to invite, and with the known 8-card fit she says 3\S.

North has a little extra so he bids 4\S, which is a pretty good contract. }

{East opens 1\S. Perhaps a little marginal, but you don't pass 13 point hands. West has a good 2/1 response of 2\C. 

East's first priority is to show a 4-card \H suit, so he does. West wouldn't dare support \Hs with only three cards, but has a good 2NT bid.

East is not happy in notrump so rebids the 6-card major, 3\S. West's two \Ss are enough support so she bids the \S game.}

[Result ""]
{South opens 1\S. North cannot say 2\H because he only has 11 points, and also because he only has 4 \Hs. So he bids 1NT (forcing for 1 round).

South rebids 2\C, a 3-card suit. North now jumps to 3\S, showing limit-raise strength. This sequence is the way to show a limit-raise with only 3 trumps; an immediate jump-raise to the 3-level shows a limit-raise with 4 trumps.

In any case South has a bare minimum and passes the invitation.}
