[Result ""]
{South opens 1\S. North has 11 points, enough to respond 2\C, (or 2\D), in standard bidding, but not when using 2/1. So she bids 1NT.

South is forced to bid again, but unlike the previous hand, here he wants to keep bidding. He bids 2\C. North knows South doesn't have \Hs, so she shows her above-minimum hand by bidding 2NT.

South is happy to play Notrump. He assumes North must have something useful in \Ds and bids 3NT.

3NT seems to be a good contract. There are 8 top tricks and possibilities for a ninth winner in either \Ss, \Ds, or, (the best chance), \Cs.}

{South opens 1\H. North responds 1NT, just as in standard bidding. The difference is that in this case the 1NT response is forcing on South.

South has an easy second bid, he rebids his 6-card suit. North has nothing to say over 2\H except pass.

Notice that this is the same bidding and same final contract that would have been reached with standard bidding. Using 2/1 is often like that.}

[Result ""]
{North opens 1\S. South responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

North cannot rebid her \Ss, but has decent support for partner's \Ds. So she bids 3\D.

South always intended to play a \S contract. He now bids 4\S, using Fast Arrival to indicate he has no slam aspirations.

4\S is cold, and if the defenders don't take their \H tricks immediately North will make an overtrick.}

[Result ""]
{North opens 1\H and East Doubles.

After the intervening Takeout Double 2/1 is OFF. If South had T or more points she would Redouble. So even with only 9 points South can bid 2\C without fear that North will think she has a strong hand.

North also knows everything mentioned above so he passes.}

1S pass 2D pass 2S pass 3S pass 4C pass 4S all pass
[Result ""]
{North opens 1\S. South responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

North has a big hand, perhaps in the slam range, but first priority is to set a trump suit. So she contents herself with a rebid of 2\S.  South agrees on trumps by bidding 3\S (not Fast Arrival).

North now makes her slam try by using a Control-showing cue-bid. She bids 4\C, showing first round control of the suit (Ace or Void).

South's next bid would be a control-showing bid of her own - IF SHE HAD ONE. Since she cannot win the first round of either red suit she just returns to 4\S. North realizes that they are off two red Aces and passes.

Notice that North did not fall into the Blackwood trap. If she HAD asked for Aces, South would have shown one Ace and North wouldn't know what to do next. She might have figured the odds favored that one Ace being a red one and tried the slam. Moral: Don't use Blackwood when you have a void.}
