{South has 13 points and naturally opens 1\S.

North, with 15 points, would bid 2\H in standard bidding, but with 2/1 this promises a 5-card suit. So instead, North responds 2\C, forcing the partnership to game. Note that holding two 4-card minors North bids them up-the-line, just as in standard bidding.

South has a nice 6-card \S suit, so you might think he would rebid them. But Opener's first responsibility with his second bid is to show a 4-card Major if he has one. This isn't much of a suit, but South still bids 2\H.

You can see why it is important for Opener to show a 4-card Major. Since North couldn't bid \Hs in her first response the fit would have been lost if South had not mentioned the suit. North now confirms the trump suit with a 3\H bid, and South shows his minimum by just bidding the game.}

{North opens 1\H, his 5-card Major. South, with 14 points, naturally responds 2\D, forcing the partnership to game.

North next bids 2\S, showing the other Major suit. In standard bidding North would not be able to bid the \Ss since that would be a Reverse and North is far too weak to Reverse. But after a 2/1 Response the concept of a Reverse does not apply, and the priority of showing a 4-card Major certainly does apply.

South assumes North to be 4-5 in the Majors, so she cannot support either. She bids 2NT. If North actually has 6 \Hs (or 5 \Ss) he will rebid the suit. South's 2NT bid guarantees a stopper in the fourth suit.

North does not have either 6 \Hs or 5 \Ss so he just bids 3NT. Notice that North never once considered the possibility of passing what might be a misfit - the initial 2/1 response unconditionally forced the partnership to reach a game somewhere.}

{South opens 1\S, his 5-card Major. North, with 14 points, responds 2\C, a 2/1 force to game.

South next bids 2\H, showing the other Major suit.

North assumes South to be 5-4 in the Majors, so she cannot support either. She cannot bid 2NT without a stopper in \Ds. So North bids the fourth suit, 3\D, telling South she knows she must make a bid, but can't find anything appropriate.

South now must find a bid. His choices include rebidding the 5-card \Ss, supporting North's \Cs with a doubleton Queen, or bidding 3NT with the \D K 6 as a stopper. He chooses this last option. It appears that 3NT is the best game for these two hands.}

{North opens 1\S, her 5-card Major and South responds 2\H. North knows this is a 5-card suit, and bids 3\H, confirming the 8+card trump fit.

Once the trump fit is known, South revalues his hand to about 19 points. He makes a slam try with  a control-showing bid of 3\S. He knows North won't take this as \S support since the partnership has agreed that \Hs are going to be trumps.

North now shows her control by bidding 4\C.

That was what South needed to hear; when Blackwood uncovers two Aces he bids 6\H.

The slam is a good one. If either the \SQ or \CK is right there are 12 tricks by way of a finesse. But the best way to play the hand would be to try to establish a \S in the North hand, and if that fails try the \C finesse.}

{South opens 1\H and North responds 2\C. Using standard bidding South would now jump to 3NT to show his 19 points, but in 2/1 this is not necessary since the partnership must not stop bidding until game is reached. So South just bids 2NT. North shows her minimum by bidding 3NT.

South will now disclose his extra strength. He bids 4NT. This is not Blackwood, but rather a quantitative raise in Notrump, and an invitation to slam.

North has 15 points, and they are good ones. She accepts the invitation and bids 6NT.

There are 11 top tricks. A 3-3 \H split would provide the 12th winner, but this is against the odds. Better to try two \S finesses, a 75% chance.}

{South opens 1\S and North responds 2\D. South has a pretty good hand, 17 points, but no stopping power in the minor suits. Also, South's \S suit is pretty ragged. Taking these points into consideration, South should just rebid his 6-card suit.

North should now jump to 4\S. This is Fast Arrival, indicating a minimum hand with no particular interest in slam.

South is happy to rest in the game contract.

Even with a combined 30 points, T tricks are certainly not a sure thing. South must hope that East holds the trump King.}
