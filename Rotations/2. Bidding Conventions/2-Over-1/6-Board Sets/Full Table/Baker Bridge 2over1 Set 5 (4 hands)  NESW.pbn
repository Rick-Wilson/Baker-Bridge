{South opens 1\S. North has a mountain, but there is seldom a need to jump-shift when using 2/1. He bids 2\H. 

South's priority on her first rebid is to agree trumps if possible. Knowing North has at least a 5-card suit, she bids 3\H.

North naturally feels slammish, and shows it with a control-showing cue-bid, 4\C. Do not even THINK this might be Gerber.

South doesn't have any extra strength, but that doesn't matter. With South making a slam try she should cooperate by showing her \D control. It is important to realize that South isn't showing any extra strength, she is merely going along with North. 

North asks for Aces and gets two. He decides to find out about Kings, if South happens to have three he will bid 7NT. When South shows just one North settles for 6\H. This should be a good slam, needing only a decent \S break.}

{East opens 1\S. With 11 points West cannot respond 2\C. So she bids 1NT, which is forcing for 1 round. 

East's first priority is to show a 4-card \H suit. Since he doesn't have one his next priority is to rebid the 6-card \Ss.

West is strong enough to invite, and with the known 8-card fit she says 3\S.

East has a little extra so he bids 4\S, which is a pretty good contract. }

{South opens 1\S. Perhaps a little marginal, but you don't pass 13 point hands. North has a good 2/1 response of 2\C. 

South's first priority is to show a 4-card \H suit, so he does. North wouldn't dare support \Hs with only three cards, but has a good 2NT bid.

South is not happy in notrump so rebids the 6-card major, 3\S. North's two \Ss are enough support so she bids the \S game.}

[Result ""]
{West opens 1\S. East cannot say 2\H because he only has 11 points, and also because he only has 4 \Hs. So he bids 1NT (forcing for 1 round).

West rebids 2\C, a 3-card suit. East now jumps to 3\S, showing limit-raise strength. This sequence is the way to show a limit-raise with only 3 trumps; an immediate jump-raise to the 3-level shows a limit-raise with 4 trumps.

In any case West has a bare minimum and passes the invitation.}
