[Result ""]
{After North's 1\H opening South counts 12 HCP plus one length point for the fifth \D. That is enough for a 2/1 response so South says 2\D.

The partnership is now forced to reach game so North bids 2NT. This describes a balanced hand with exactly 5 \Hs and no 4-card \S suit.

South is happy to play in Notrump, and with no extra strength above the 13 points already promised, uses Quick Arrival and bids 3NT. North passes and a reasonable game contract is reached.

Notice that you would bid this hand the same way whether or not you play 2/1.}

[Result ""]
{East opens 1\H and West, with 16 points,  responds 2\D, forcing the partnership to game.

East has a minimum strength hand, but with a 6-card suit he rebids 2\H.

Opposite East's 6-card suit, West's doubleton is adequate support. If West had a minimum for her 2/1 response she might just jump to 4\H to show no interest in slam. With a little extra she bids 3\H since she knows the bidding cannot stop until game is reached. From West's perspective East might have a big hand; his 2-level rebid shows suit length but does not say anything about strength. This is one of the beauties of 2/1, the bidding can be kept low while you look for the best place to play. However, this time East merely bids the game and West passes.

The hand would have been bid the same with or without 2/1.}

[Result ""]
{With 16+ points and 3 \Hs, North will insist on a \H game at a minimum. But there is no need to start making jump bids, she starts with a simple 2\D bid. South also refrains from a jump, and rebids 2\H to show the 6-card suit.

North now says 3\H to set the trump suit. At this point South reveals some slam interest, making a control-showing bid of 4\C. North continues the process, and bids 4\D, showing the \DA.

South has heard enough. He bids 4NT, and when North admits to two Aces he bids the slam.}

[Result ""]
{West has a minimum 1\S opening bid. After North's 2\D overcall both West and East know that the 2/1 Game Force in no longer on. East can therefore bid 2\H, showing at least 11 points. This bid is forcing on West for 1 round, but not forcing to game.

West next rebids his \Ss, promising a 6-card suit, but also indicating a minimum strength hand! Since the Game Force is not on, West would have to make a jump bid to show extra strength.

East has nothing further to say so the partnership arrives in a safe contract.}

{North opens 1\S, the higher ranking of the two 5-card suits.

South, with 14 points, responds 2\C, forcing the partnership to game.

North now bids his \H suit.

At this point South figures North for 5 \Ss and 4 \Hs. South cannot support either of North's Majors, but with a good stopper in the fourth suit bids 2NT. The game force is still on and North may not pass this bid.

North bids 3\H, indicating that this is also a 5-card suit. Now South can bid the \H game, knowing there is an 8-card fit.}

[Result ""]
{West opens 1\S and East, with 14 points, responds 2\H. Note that East is not permitted to make this bid without a 5-card or longer \H suit.

West, knowing that East has 5, bids 3\H to confirm the trump suit.

East has a minimum strength hand with no slam aspirations, so he uses Fast Arrival and bids 4\H. West is also satisfied to just play at game.

2/1 is a good bidding method, and here, 4\H is a good contract. But you can see that it is not a laydown - there is no bidding system that will always reach T0% contracts. In this hand a 3-3 \D split will provide the Tth trick, or if that fails, taking 2 \S finesses provides a 75% chance of success.}
