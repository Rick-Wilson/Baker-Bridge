{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 10 points and a great 6-card suit this is a perfect Weak 2-Bid. You open 2\D. East passes and partner jumps to 4\D. West passes. What do you say? 

This is not an invitation to bid game. If partner had game interest he would bid 2NT. Apparently he is trying to preempt the opponents out of their hand and apparently it is working. You pass.}

You should pass. You have 15 points, and if partner has the maximum of 11 it seems you might be able to make a game. But your points are trashy points. What a Weak 2-bidder usually needs are Aces and Kings, while you have an assortment of Queens and Jacks. }

The 2NT bid is forcing. Your \DK is a feature, but your immediate priority is to let partner know that you have a minimum strength opener, 6, 7 or 8 points. So you rebid 3\H. Partner passes.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above.

You open with a Weak 2-Bid, 2\S. Partner responds 2NT. What do you say next?

The 2NT bid is forcing. You have 11 points so you cannot reply 3\S. And your suit is not A K Q x x x so you cannot reply 3NT. That means you must bid a "feature" and your \HQ is the best you have. You bid 3\H and partner says 3\S. What do you say?

Pass. When you have already described your hand perfectly, partner becomes the Captain.}

You should jump to 4\S, hoping to shut them out of their \H slam. As you can see they have at most one \S loser. Down 3 doubled for your side is much better than letting them bid and make a slam. Of course we know they should have continued bidding, but opponents sometimes make mistakes.}
