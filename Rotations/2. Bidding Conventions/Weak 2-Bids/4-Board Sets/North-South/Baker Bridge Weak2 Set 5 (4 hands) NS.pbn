{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have a perfect 2\D opening except for one thing. Well, except for four things really, those four \Ss. So you pass. Then partner opens 1\S. What do you say? 

Well, we have passed out of the realm of Weak Twos and into Major Suit Raises! No problem, it's all Bridge. Youmake a limit raise of 3\S and partner bids 4\S.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You know partner must have the \SK since he wouldn't open a Jack-high suit. You need to find out if he has an outside Ace. So you bid 4NT and he answers 5\D.  

Partner has one Ace. Bid 6\S.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You open with a Weak 2-Bid, 2\H. Partner responds 2\S. What do you say next? 

The 2\S bid is forcing for one round, but you want to bid again anyway. While you had an 11 point hand when you opened 2\H it has actually grown in value in support of \Ss. It is a question whether you should now bid 3\S or 4\S. Let's assume you say 3\S and partner raises to 4\S.}

You know have just a 6-card \H fit so you can be no worse off in \Ss. You respond 2\S and partner raises to 3\S.
