{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You should raise to 4\S. Not that you expect partner to make it, he probably cannot.  Your raise is a preemptive measure, hoping to prevent the opponents from finding their \H fit. }

[Result ""]
{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above.

You open with a Weak 2-Bid, 2\S. Partner responds 2NT. What do you say next?

The 2NT bid is forcing. You have 11 points so you cannot reply 3\S. And your suit is not A K Q x x x so you cannot reply 3NT. That means you must bid a "feature" and your \HQ is the best you have. You bid 3\H and partner says 3\S. What do you say?

Pass. When you have already described your hand perfectly, partner becomes the Captain.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You should jump to 4\S, hoping to shut them out of their \H slam. As you can see they have at most one \S loser. Down 3 doubled for your side is much better than letting them bid and make a slam. Of course we know they should have continued bidding, but opponents sometimes make mistakes.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You open with a Weak 2-Bid, 2\D. Partner responds 2NT. What do you say next? 

The 2NT bid is forcing and your suit is A K Q x x x. This is the standard guideline where you must rebid 3NT. When you do, partner passes. Nice.}
