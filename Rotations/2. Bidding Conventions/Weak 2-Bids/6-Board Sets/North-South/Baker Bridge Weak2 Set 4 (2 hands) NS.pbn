{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You open with a Weak 2-Bid, 2\H. Partner responds 2\S. What do you say next? 

The 2\S bid is forcing for one round, but you want to bid again anyway. While you had an 11 point hand when you opened 2\H it has actually grown in value in support of \Ss. It is a question whether you should now bid 3\S or 4\S. Let's assume you say 3\S and partner raises to 4\S.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You know have just a 6-card \H fit so you can be no worse off in \Ss. You respond 2\S and partner raises to 3\S.  

It isn't a sure thing, but take a chance. Bid 4\S.}
