{You have 16 points and you respond 1\S. Partner rebids 2NT. What is your next bid? 

Partner has 18-19 points, balanced, with 5 \Hs. You are going to bid a slam, either 6NT or 6\S, depending on whether partner has 3 \Ss. Time for New Minor Forcing. 

You bid 3\C rather than 3\D just because your \Cs are stronger. Partner now says 3NT. What do you bid? 

Partner does not have 3 \Ss. That was the information you needed, so you bid 6NT.}

[Result ""]
{You are the dealer.  

You have 13 points and you open 1\D. Partner responds 1\S.  

With a minimum opener you now bid 1NT. Partner says 2\C. What do you say next? 

This is NMF, asking you to further describe your hand - and you are stuck for a bid. You do not have 4 \Hs. You do not have 3 \Ss. You do not have a stopper in either \Hs or \Cs so you cannot bid 2NT. Reluctantly you rebid your 5-card \D suit.

Then you breathe a sigh of relief when partner says 3NT.}
