{You have 12 points and you respond 1\S. Partner rebids 1NT. What do you say next? 

Partner has 12-14 points, balanced. You have an excellent 4-card \H suit, but if you bid 2\H right now it is not forcing on partner and he will almost surely pass. And you definitely don't have the points to jump to 3\H. New Minor Forcing gives you a way out.

So you say 2\D and your wonderful partner bids 2\H. What now? 

Your 12 points just got upgraded! Bid 4\H.}

{You are the dealer.  

This 14 point hand is almost good enough to open 1NT, but you bid 1\D. Partner responds 1\H. What do you bid next? 

You could bid either 1NT or 2\C. You decide on 1NT.

Partner says 2\C. What do you bid? 

This is NMF, asking if you have 3 \Hs. You only have 2, but you have a great notrump hand now. Since partner must have at least invitational strength you jump right to 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{With 15 points you are going to insist on game. First you respond 1\H. Partner rebids 1NT. What do you say next? 

Partner has 12-14 points, balanced. You are happy with notrump, but would prefer to play in \Hs if partner has three cards in the suit. To find out if he does, use New Minor Forcing.

So you say 2\C and partner replies 2NT. It is your bid again. 

Partner doesn't have 3 \Hs. That's what you wanted to know, you bid 3NT.}

{You are the dealer.  

You have 14 points and you open 1\D. Partner responds 1\S.  

You cannot bid 2\H because a Reverse shows at least 16 points. So you bid 1NT. Partner says 2\C.  

This is NMF, asking you to further describe your hand. You do not have 3 \Ss. You do have a 4-card \H suit. You have a maximum hand for your previous bidding, so you jump to 3\H. Partner raises to 4\H.}

{You have 14 points and you respond 1\S. Partner rebids 1NT. What is your next bid? 

Partner has 12-14 points, balanced. You will insist on reaching game, but don't know whether 3NT or 4\S is going to be the best spot. It depends on whether partner has 3 \Ss. So of course you use NMF.

You bid 2\D and partner then says 2\H. Where do you go from here? 

OK, partner has a 4-card \H suit - may or may not have 3 \Ss. Since you don't have 4 \Hs you bid 3NT, leaving it up to partner to correct to 4\S if he has 3 of them.}

{You are the dealer.  

You are too strong for 1NT so you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\S.  

You don't support \Ss with only 3 cards since partner might well have just a 4-card suit. With 18 points, balanced, all suits stopped, you jump to 2NT.

Partner says 3\D. What do you bid? 

This is New Minor Forcing. Partner wants to know if you have 3 \Ss. Since you do have 3 you bid 3\S and partner raises to 4\S.}
