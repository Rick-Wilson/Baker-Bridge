{With 14 points you will insist on game, but you aren't strong enough to jump shift. So you bid 1\S. Partner rebids 1NT.  

Partner has a minimum hand, balanced. You know you want to be in game, but you aren't sure which game. If partner has only 2 \Ss then 3NT should be best. But if he has 3 \Ss then you would prefer to play the 8-card Major fit. The way to find out is with New Minor Forcing. So you bid 2\D. Partner answers with 2\S.  

Partner tells you he has 3 \Ss. You already know he has a minimum strength hand. You bid the \S game.}

{You are the dealer.  

With 13 points and 4 cards in each minor suit you should open 1\D. Partner responds 1\S.  

You have a minimum, balanced hand. It would not be wrong to say 2\C, but 1NT is probably better. Partner says 2\C.  

Do not support the \Cs if you have another decent bid. This is New Minor Forcing and partner may or may not have a \C suit. You do not have 3 \Ss. You do not have a 4-card \H suit. You do have a \H stopper, so bid 2NT. Partner then bids 3NT.}

{With 12 points you know game is likely, but for now you bid 1\H. Partner rebids 1NT. What do you say next? 

Partner has 12-14 points, balanced. If he is at the top, game could still be there, but you aren't sure where to play. If partner has only 2 \Hs then NT is probably best, but if he has 3 \Hs then you would prefer to play the 8-card Major fit. New Minor Forcing will allow partner to answer both questions for you. So you bid 2\C. Partner answers with 2\H.  

Partner tells you he has 3 \Hs. But he also tells you he has minimum strength - in other words not 14 points. So you pass and accept the partscore.}

{You are the dealer.  

With 13 points you open your 4-card minor, 1\D. Partner responds 1\S.  

You have a great \H suit, but can't bid it. A 2\H bid here would be a Reverse and you are nowhere near strong enough. So instead you say 1NT.

Partner says 2\C. What do you bid? 

This is New Minor Forcing and your first priority is to show a 4-card \H suit. You bid 2\H and partner raises to 4\H.}

{You are the dealer.  

With 14 points you open your 4-card minor, 1\C. Partner responds 1\H.  

This is easy. You cannot support \Hs at this point with only 3 cards. So you rebid 1NT.

Partner says 2\D. What do you bid? 

This is New Minor Forcing. Partner wants to know if you have 3 \Hs. Not only do you have 3 good \Hs, but you also have a maximum hand. So you jump to 3\H and partner bids the game.}
