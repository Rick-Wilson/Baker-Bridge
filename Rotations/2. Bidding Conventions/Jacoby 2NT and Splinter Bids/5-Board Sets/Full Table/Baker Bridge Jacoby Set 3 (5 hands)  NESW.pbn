{It is your bid. 

Partner has at least opening hand and he has 4 \Ss. There is only one thing you need to know - how many Aces he has. You bid Blackwood 4NT and he responds 5\S. What is your next bid? 

The three Aces does it for you. You can count 7 \S tricks, 3 \H tricks, 2 \D tricks and 1 \C. That is 13 total so you go ahead and bid 7NT.}

{It is your bid. 

You have an opening hand with four of partner's Major suit so naturally you want to force to game. Although you could bid a Jacoby 2NT, the presence of the singleton \S makes a Splinter Bid more attractive. So you double-jump to 3\S. Partner now bids 4\C. What do you say next? 

Partner's 4\C bid is control showing, and indicates he is thinking slammish. You bid 4\D showing your control and partner bids 6\H.

As you can see, East should make 12 tricks by discarding one \C loser on your \DA.}

{It is your bid. 

When the opponents interfere, Jacoby is off. Now a cue-bid response by partner shows a hand with good trump support, and a limit raise or better in strength. So partner might have a game forcing hand, but also might have only 11 points.

But he definitely has \S support. You show your minimum hand by bidding 3\S and he passes.}

{It is your bid. 

 back to Deal 12 for a quick comparison between the two hands. Almost identical, but this time your singleton is the \SK. Since it is not advisable to Splinter with a singleton Ace, King or Queen you just bid 2NT instead. Partner jumps to 4\H and you pass.

Note that in this hand the three points you credited for your \SK are completely wasted. And although partner has the same hand as he did in Deal 12, this time there is no chance of making slam. This shows why you don't Splinter with singleton Honors.}

{It is your bid. 

When partner Splinters his singleton \C you should realize that the only thing that could keep you from making slam would be lack of Aces. So you bid 4NT. Partner shows only one Ace so you just sign off at 5\H.}
