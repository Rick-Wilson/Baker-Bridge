{It is your bid. 

With 15 points and four of partner's suit you naturally bid 2NT. Partner now jumps to 4\H. What do you say? 

Partner's rebid of 4\H is not strong. He is using the Principle of Fast Arrival to indicate a minimum opening hand. Since you have nothing extra you pass quietly.}

{It is your bid. 

Although you could show your singleton \C now it is usually more informative to show a second 5-card suit. So you say 4\D. Partner bids 4\H. What do you say? 

Partner signed off, showing a minimum, so you have nothing further to say.}

{It is your bid. 

Opening hand with 4-card trump support. You bid 2NT. Partner rebids 3\D. What do you say? 

The news that partner has a singleton \D does NOT excite you. In fact it causes your hand to devalue a lot. So you use the Principle of Fast Arrival and bid 4\H.}

[Result ""]
{It is your bid. 

Partner's 3\S bid is a Splinter, showing a singleton \S, good trump support, and 13-16 points. You bid your first-round \C control, and partner replies with 4\D. What do you bid next? 

There isn't really anything else you want to know. You think you can make slam so you bid 6\H.}

{It is your bid. 

You have a perfect Jacoby 2NT raise. Partner's rebid is 3\H. What is your next bid? 

When partner shows an above average opener it is your duty to make a control bid if you can. So you bid 3\S. Partner now bids 4NT and it is your turn. 

This is Blackwood. You respond 5\H for two Aces and partner bids the slam.}
