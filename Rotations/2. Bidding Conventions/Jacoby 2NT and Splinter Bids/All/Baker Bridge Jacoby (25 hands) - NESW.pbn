You have just a little extra so you bid 3\C to show a singleton. Partner says 3\H and it is your bid again. 

Partner's bid means he has first round \H control, obviously the \HA. But it also denies holding the \DA since control bids are made up-the-line. You show your lack of a Minor suit Ace by returning to 3\S. Partner signs off at game.

You could equally have just bid 4\S yourself.}

With opening hand and 4-card \S support this is an ideal Jacoby 2NT response. Partner says 3NT.  

West has some extra strength and a 5-card \S suit. This is the point in the bidding where you would make a control bid, showing an Ace. Well, you would if you actually had an Ace. The way you indicate your lack of a control is to just return the the agreed trump suit. So you bid 4\S and partner passes.}

Partner's 4\C bid is control showing, and indicates he is thinking slammish. You bid 4\D showing your control and partner bids 6\H.

As you can see, West should make 12 tricks by discarding one \C loser on your \DA.}

 back to Deal 12 for a quick comparison between the two hands. Almost identical, but this time your singleton is the \SK. Since it is not advisable to Splinter with a singleton Ace, King or Queen you just bid 2NT instead. Partner jumps to 4\H and you pass.

Note that in this hand the three points you credited for your \SK are completely wasted. And although partner has the same hand as he did in Deal 12, this time there is no chance of making slam. This shows why you don't Splinter with singleton Honors.}

{It is your bid. 

You have a great hand, but no singleton to show. Since you have a 6-card \H suit you bid 3\H. Partner replies 3\S. What do you bid? 

Partner has control-bid the \SA. He may also have one or both of the Minor Aces since he would have bid the cheapest control first. You use Blackwood. He replies 5\D. What do you bid? 

Oops. Despite all the points you are missing two Aces. So you thank Mr. Blackwood and sign off at 5\H.}

{It is your bid. 

You don't want to make a Splinter Bid with a singleton King so you content yourself with a Jacoby 2NT bid. Partner rebids 4\D. What do you say next? 

The 4\D bid shows a 5-card \D suit. What you need to know now is how many Aces partner has. You bid 4NT and he answers 5\H. What do you say? 

He has two Aces so you bid 6\S.}

{It is your bid. 

With 18 points you want to show your extra strength. Since you have only 5 trumps you show the strength by bidding 3NT. Partner then bids 4\C. What do you say next? 

Now is the time when YOU would make a control bid. And if you had either red Ace you would do so. Since you don't have one, you have no option but to say 4\S. Partner recognizes that you are off those two Aces and passes.}
