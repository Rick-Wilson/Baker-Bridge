{It is your bid. 

Partner's 3\S bid is a Splinter, showing a singleton \S, good trump support, and 13-16 points. You bid your first-round \C control, and partner replies with 4\D. What do you bid next? 

There isn't really anything else you want to know. You think you can make slam so you bid 6\H.}

{It is your bid. 

You have a perfect Jacoby 2NT raise. Partner's rebid is 3\H. What is your next bid? 

When partner shows an above average opener it is your duty to make a control bid if you can. So you bid 3\S. Partner now bids 4NT and it is your turn. 

This is Blackwood. You respond 5\H for two Aces and partner bids the slam.}

{It is your bid. 

Partner has at least opening hand and he has 4 \Ss. There is only one thing you need to know - how many Aces he has. You bid Blackwood 4NT and he responds 5\S. What is your next bid? 

The three Aces does it for you. You can count 7 \S tricks, 3 \H tricks, 2 \D tricks and 1 \C. That is 13 total so you go ahead and bid 7NT.}

[Result ""]
{It is your bid. 

You have an opening hand with four of partner's Major suit so naturally you want to force to game. Although you could bid a Jacoby 2NT, the presence of the singleton \S makes a Splinter Bid more attractive. So you double-jump to 3\S. Partner now bids 4\C. What do you say next? 

Partner's 4\C bid is control showing, and indicates he is thinking slammish. You bid 4\D showing your control and partner bids 6\H.

As you can see, South should make 12 tricks by discarding one \C loser on your \DA.}
