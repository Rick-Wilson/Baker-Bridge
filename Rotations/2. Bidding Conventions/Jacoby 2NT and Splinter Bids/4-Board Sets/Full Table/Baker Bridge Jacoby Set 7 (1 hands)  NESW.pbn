[Result ""]
{It is your bid. 

With 18 points you want to show your extra strength. Since you have only 5 trumps you show the strength by bidding 3NT. Partner then bids 4\C. What do you say next? 

Now is the time when YOU would make a control bid. And if you had either red Ace you would do so. Since you don't have one, you have no option but to say 4\S. Partner recognizes that you are off those two Aces and passes.}
