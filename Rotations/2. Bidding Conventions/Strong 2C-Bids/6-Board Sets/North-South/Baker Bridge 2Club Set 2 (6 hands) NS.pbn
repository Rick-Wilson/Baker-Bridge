{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 22 points you should open 2\C. Partner responds 2\D. What do you bid next? 

You have 22 points and 5-card Major suit. Your rebid is therefore 2\S. Partner raises to 4\S. His jump to game shows a weaker hand than a 3\S bid would so you pass.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have 6 points and bid a Negative 2\D. Partner now bids 2NT. What is your bid? 

Partner has a balanced 22-24 points. With your 6 you want to be in game, but which game; 3NT, 4\H or 4\S? You can't answer that question unless you know if partner has a 4-card Major suit. So you bid 3\C, which is Stayman in this case. Partner replies 3\H. What do you say? 

Knowing of the 4-4 fit you bid 4\H. By the way: Partner knew your 3\C bid was not the Second Negative because you don't use Second Negative following a 2NT rebid, you just pass.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 23 points you open 2\C. Partner responds 2\D. What do you bid next? 

You bid your 5-card \H suit. Partner says 2NT.  

Partner's 2NT shows scattered values and fewer than 3 \Hs. He has 3 or more points or he would have bid the Double Negative. So you say 3NT.}

You have 11 points and partner opens 2\C. Wow!You answer 2NT and he bids 3NT. What is your next bid? 

Hmmm, 22-24 balanced, plus 11 balanced equals 33-35 balanced. It makes you think a jump to 6NT would work out great. Just do it.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With just 1 Jack you bid a Negative 2\D. Partner now bids 2\S. What is your bid? 

Partner's bid of a suit is absolutely forcing, no matter how you feel about it. But now is the time you tell him you have fewer than 3 points by using the Second Negative. You bid 3\C. Partner now says 3\H. What do you say? 

No, you still may not pass. First, because partner's bid of a new suit is forcing. Second, because even if you were not forced you prefer his first suit. So you bid 3\S and he passes.}

With a true Yarborough you qualify to respond a Negative 2\D. Partner now bids 3\C. What is your bid? 

You now inform partner of your disaster hand by using the Second Negative. Since his suit is \Cs the Second Negative is 3\D. Partner now says 3NT. What do you say? 

You definitely pass. Good thing he has 9 cold tricks in his hand!}
