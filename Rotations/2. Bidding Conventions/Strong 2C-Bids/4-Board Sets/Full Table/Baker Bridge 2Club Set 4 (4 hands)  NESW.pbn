{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 24 points you open 2\C. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid next? 

Partner has 8+ points and a good 5-card \H suit. Your hand has revalued to 25 points. You are forced to game but you don't want to bid it yet since you have slam in mind. So you temporize by showing your \H support. Partner bids 4\H. What do say? 

You bid 4NT, asking for Aces. Partner replies 5\D. What now? 

You now say 6\H and lay down a great dummy.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have 8 points and an excellent 5-card Major. So you respond 2\S. Partner says 3\S. What do you bid? 

You told him that you have 8 or more points, now you must tell him that it is only 8. So you bid 4\S, making no move toward slam, and he passes.}

You show your balanced minimum by bidding 3NT, leaving further moves to partner. Partner moves to 6NT which you pass.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

It's like a Bridge fantasy come true. But don't go crazy, wait to see what kind of hand partner has. Remember, anything you say will be forcing. So you answer 2NT and he bids 3NT. What is your next bid? 

Hmmm, 22-24 points added to your 16 comes to 38-40 points. Looking apologetically at your poor opponents you bid 7NT.}
