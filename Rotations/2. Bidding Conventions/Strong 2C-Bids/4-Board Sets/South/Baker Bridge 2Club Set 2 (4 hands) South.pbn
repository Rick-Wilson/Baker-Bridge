{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You only have 20 points, but you have 9 playing tricks. You have two choices, open 4\H or open 2\C. Usually 4\H would show a slightly weaker hand than this, so you bid 2\C. Partner responds 2\D. What do you bid next? 

Of course you bid your 8-card suit. But no jumping, just bid 2\H. Partner now says 2NT. What do you bid next? 

Partner has between 3 and 7 points. Somewhere in those points might be the one trick you need, but you don't have any scientific way of finding out. So just bid 4\H and hope.(There it is, the \CT.)}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 7 points you must bid a Negative 2\D. Partner now bids 2\H. What is your bid? 

For someone who made an initial Negative response you have quite a good hand. You can't support partner's \Hs (yet) but you consider jumping to 3NT. All in all it is better to just describe your hand with a 3\D bid, then wait and see what partner says. You don't have to wait long since he bids 3NT which you pass.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 22 points you should open 2\C. Partner responds 2\D. What do you bid next? 

You have 22 points and 5-card Major suit. Your rebid is therefore 2\S. Partner raises to 4\S. His jump to game shows a weaker hand than a 3\S bid would so you pass.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have 6 points and bid a Negative 2\D. Partner now bids 2NT. What is your bid? 

Partner has a balanced 22-24 points. With your 6 you want to be in game, but which game; 3NT, 4\H or 4\S? You can't answer that question unless you know if partner has a 4-card Major suit. So you bid 3\C, which is Stayman in this case. Partner replies 3\H. What do you say? 

Knowing of the 4-4 fit you bid 4\H. By the way: Partner knew your 3\C bid was not the Second Negative because you don't use Second Negative following a 2NT rebid, you just pass.}
