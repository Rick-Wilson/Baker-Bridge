{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 23 points you naturally open 2\C. Partner responds 2\D. What do you bid next? 

You have 23 points and no 5-card suit. Since your hand is balanced you bid 2NT. Partner raises to 3NT and you pass.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With only 2 points you make a Negative 2\D response to partner's 2\C opener. He now bids 2NT. What is your bid? 

This isn't as clear-cut a decision as you might think at first. Partner is showing 22-24 points, and even though you only have 2 points it is possible that the partnership total could be 26. The thing that should convince you to pass is that a 24-2 point split doesn't play nearly as well as say a 13-13 split would. Lack of transportation would likely kill any chance of 3NT (or 4\S). So you pass.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With only 4 points you make a Negative 2\D response to partner's 2\C opener. He now bids 2NT. What is your bid? 

True, 4 points isn't much. But added to partner's 22-24 it becomes enough for a game. Your problem isn't whether to bid to the game or not, (you definitely will), but whether you should use Stayman to find out if there is a 4-4 \S fit. You decide not to do this because your 4-3-3-3 distribution removes the possibility of you getting any ruffs. So you bid 3NT.}
