{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With only 2 points you make a Negative 2\D response to partner's 2\C opener. He now bids 2NT. What is your bid? 

This isn't as clear-cut a decision as you might think at first. Partner is showing 22-24 points, and even though you only have 2 points it is possible that the partnership total could be 26. The thing that should convince you to pass is that a 24-2 point split doesn't play nearly as well as say a 13-13 split would. Lack of transportation would likely kill any chance of 3NT (or 4\S). So you pass.}

With only 4 points you make a Negative 2\D response to partner's 2\C opener. He now bids 2NT. What is your bid? 

True, 4 points isn't much. But added to partner's 22-24 it becomes enough for a game. Your problem isn't whether to bid to the game or not, (you definitely will), but whether you should use Stayman to find out if there is a 4-4 \S fit. You decide not to do this because your 4-3-3-3 distribution removes the possibility of you getting any ruffs. So you bid 3NT.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You only have 20 points, but you have 9 playing tricks. You have two choices, open 4\H or open 2\C. Usually 4\H would show a slightly weaker hand than this, so you bid 2\C. Partner responds 2\D. What do you bid next? 

Of course you bid your 8-card suit. But no jumping, just bid 2\H. Partner now says 2NT. What do you bid next? 

Partner has between 3 and 7 points. Somewhere in those points might be the one trick you need, but you don't have any scientific way of finding out. So just bid 4\H and hope.(There it is, the \CT.)}

For someone who made an initial Negative response you have quite a good hand. You can't support partner's \Hs (yet) but you consider jumping to 3NT. All in all it is better to just describe your hand with a 3\D bid, then wait and see what partner says. You don't have to wait long since he bids 3NT which you pass.}

Partner has a balanced 22-24 points. With your 6 you want to be in game, but which game; 3NT, 4\H or 4\S? You can't answer that question unless you know if partner has a 4-card Major suit. So you bid 3\C, which is Stayman in this case. Partner replies 3\H. What do you say? 

Knowing of the 4-4 fit you bid 4\H. By the way: Partner knew your 3\C bid was not the Second Negative because you don't use Second Negative following a 2NT rebid, you just pass.}

No, you still may not pass. First, because partner's bid of a new suit is forcing. Second, because even if you were not forced you prefer his first suit. So you bid 3\S and he passes.}
