{You open in third seat and the bidding continues as shown.  

Partner has a limit raise in \Ss and wonders if you have a full strength opening bid. Your 15 point hand is enough to insist on game, but opposite a passed hand you have no interest in a slam.

So you sign-off at 4\S.}

{With 11 points in support of \Ss you need to let partner know. The way to do it is to bid 2\C.

Partner rebids 2\D, confirming a full-strength opening bid. What do you bid next? 

You've told partner you had at least a limit raise, now you need to tell him that it is pretty minimal. You bid 2\S and everybody passes.}

{You open in third seat and the bidding continues as shown.  

If you thought North had 11 points you'd bid 4\S. But you know he has a weak hand - with T+ points and support he would have said 2\C.

His 3\S bid is just preemptive, so you pass.}
