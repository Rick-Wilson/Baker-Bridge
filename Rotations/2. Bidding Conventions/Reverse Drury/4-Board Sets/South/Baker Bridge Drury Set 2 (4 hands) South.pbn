{You like partner's \H suit but you have very little defensive strength. This is a good hand to preempt the bidding, trying to keep them from finding a \S fit.

So you jump to 3\H. Partner realizes you don't have any strength since you did not invoke Reverse Drury. He passes and you have bought the contract. It appears that their side might be able to make 4\S.}

{You open in third seat and the bidding continues as shown.  

Partner has a limit raise in \Ss and wonders if you have a full strength opening bid. Your 15 point hand is enough to insist on game, but opposite a passed hand you have no interest in a slam.

So you sign-off at 4\S.}

{With 11 points in support of \Ss you need to let partner know. The way to do it is to bid 2\C.

Partner rebids 2\D, confirming a full-strength opening bid. What do you bid next? 

You've told partner you had at least a limit raise, now you need to tell him that it is pretty minimal. You bid 2\S and everybody passes.}

{You open in third seat and the bidding continues as shown.  

If you thought North had 11 points you'd bid 4\S. But you know he has a weak hand - with T+ points and support he would have said 2\C.

His 3\S bid is just preemptive, so you pass.}
