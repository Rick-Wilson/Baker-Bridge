{Partner's jump to 4\S indicates he is prepared to play at game even if you have as few as 6 points. So he must have 20 points or so. With your 14 that puts you in slam range. Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

Despite your conviction that this hand is going to slam you should NOT ask for Key-Cards holding a worthless doubleton. Instead, you make a slam try by bidding your cheapest control, 5\C. Partner says 5\H. What is your next bid? 

You can only say 5\S. Partner would have control-bid \Ds if he held the Ace since controls are bid up-the-line. His failure to show it means he doesn't have it. Since you might be off the first two \D tricks you stop at 5\S.

Yes, partner should probably have opened 2NT. Sometimes partners don't make the bids you think they oughta.}

What you need to know now about partner's hand is Key-Cards so you bid 4NT. He answers 5\S. What is your bid?

Partner's response says 2 Key-Cards and the \SQ. So you are missing either the trump King or the \DA. So you shouldn't bid 7, but you will almost surely make 6. You bid 6\S.}

{Your partner's 3\H is a limit-raise, 11-12 points with \H support. Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

What you want to know is whether partner holds the \SA. If you bid 4NT and he shows two Key-Cards all will be well, you will know they are the two missing Aces. But if he shows just 1 Key-Card you will be in the soup since you can't tell if that Key-Card is the useful \SA or the practically useless \DA. So you don't use RKCB, you use control-showing and bid 4\C. Partner says 4\H. What do you bid next? 

Partner would have control-bid \Ds if he had the Ace. You may not think that helps but it does since now you can bid RKCB. You bid 4NT and he answers 5\C. What is your next bid? 

It was a lot of work but you have figured out that partner holds 11-12 points including one Key-Card which must be the \SA. It looks like the slam is a good idea so you say 6\H.}

You say "Darn!" You are missing just one Key-Card, but you are also missing the trump Queen. And with partner holding only a 4-card suit that Queen might well win a trick. Knowing that at best the slam will depend on a trump finesse you pass 5\H.}

{Partner's 3\S is a limit raise, 11-12 points and good \S support. Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

What you DO NOT say next is 4NT. If partner answered 1 Key-Card you would not know what to do. If he has a red Ace you can make slam, but if his one Key-Card were the \CA you couldn't. Instead you make a control-showing bid of 4\C, promising first round control. Partner obliges you by bidding 4\H. What is your next bid? 

</table>

Partner's bidding is like the Sherlock Holmes tale <u>Silver Blaze</u>, about the dog that didn't bark. Partner's \H bid shows that he DOES have the \HA, but equally important it shows that he DOES NOT have the \DA. So you know you don't have a \H loser but do have a \D loser. You bid 6\S.}
