{Your 4\D bid is a Splinter Bid, showing opening hand strength, at least 4 \Ss, and a singleton or void in \Ds. Partner bids 4NT.  

You have 2 Key-Cards, the \SK and the \CA. So do you bid 5\H?

No. You have two Key-Cards AND a void. So you bid 5NT. Partner bids 6\S.}

[Result ""]
{Your partner's 2NT opener is 20-21 points and the 3\C bid is Stayman. Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

You know of 33 points and you know of an 8-card \H fit. The math tells you that 6\H should be a good slam but you might as well check Key-Cards, that's why the convention was invented. So you bid 4NT and partner answers 5\H. What do you say? 

You say "Darn!" You are missing just one Key-Card, but you are also missing the trump Queen. And with partner holding only a 4-card suit that Queen might well win a trick. Knowing that at best the slam will depend on a trump finesse you pass 5\H.}

{With 11 points and a good suit you should make a positive response. So you bid 2\H. Partner then says 4NT. What is your bid? 

The 4NT bid agrees \Hs as trump. You have one Key-Card, the \HK, so you bid 5\C. Partner bids the \H slam.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

Your partner has shown a minimum opening hand, but with 6 \Ss. You are happy with the 8-card trump fit but need to know about Key-Cards. So you bid 4NT. Partner answers 5\S and it is your bid again. 

Partner has two Aces and the \SQ. That should be all he needs to make slam so you bid 6\S.}

Partner has 15-17 points and 4 \Ss. You have 18 points and 4 \Ss. You plan to bid the slam, but first you check Key-Cards. So you bid 4NT. Partner says 5\C. What do you bid? 

You are missing 1 Key-Card. Slam has become less certain. You decide to see if partner has the trump Queen so you bid 5\D. Partner bids 5\S. What do you say next? 

Partner denies having the \SQ. Knowing that the best you could hope for would be a finesse to make the slam you give up your quest and pass.}
