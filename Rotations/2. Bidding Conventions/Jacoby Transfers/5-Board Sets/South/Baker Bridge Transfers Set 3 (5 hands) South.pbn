{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\D. What do you bid? 

This is an easy one. Partner has commanded you to say 2\H. So you say 2\H. Partner now bids 2NT.

What is your bid? 

Partner's bidding shows 9 points and exactly 5\H. He asks that you take him back to \Hs if you have 3 of them. You don't. He is asking you to bid game if you have 17 points or a good 16. You don't.

So you pass.}

{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\H. What do you bid? 

Naturally you say 2\S. Partner comes back with 2NT.

What do you bid? 

Partner's bidding shows 9 points and exactly 5\S. He asks that you take him back to \Ss if you have 3 of them. You don't. He is asking you to bid game if you have 17 points. You do.

So you bid 3NT.}

{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\D. What do you bid? 

Partner's command is your wish - you say 2\H.

He now bids 2NT. What do you say? 

Partner's bidding shows 9 points and exactly 5\H. He asks that you take him back to \Hs if you have 3 of them. You do. He is asking you to bid game if you have 17 points. You do.

So you bid 4\H.

With your 3-3-3-4 distribution you might have been tempted to bid 3NT instead of 4\H. It's a good thing you didn't, they would have killed you in \Ss.}

[Result ""]
{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\H. What do you bid? 

The initial response to a transfer is really easy. You bid 2\S.

But what do you bid after partner then says 3\S? 

Partner has 6 \Ss and you have 2. So a \S contract is fine.

Partner has 9 points and you have 15. So a game contract is too high.

You pass. And you're going to have to play great to make even 9 tricks!}

{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\D. What do you bid? 

You follow orders and say 2\H.

Partner follows up with 3\H. What do you bid next? 

Partner has 9 points and 6 \Hs. You have 17 points and 3 \Hs. That adds up to 26 points and 9 \Hs. You have enough points for game and enough trumps to play \Hs so you bid 4\H.}
