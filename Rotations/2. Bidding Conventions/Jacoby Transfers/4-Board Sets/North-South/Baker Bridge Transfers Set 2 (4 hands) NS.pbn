{North opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

You should bid 2\D to transfer partner to \Hs. He bids 2\H. What do you say now? 

You know you have at least an 8-card \H fit. You know you have at least 26 points (15 + 11). She who knows, goes, so you bid 4\H.}

{North opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

You transfer of course, but to which Major? It can work either way, but the preferred method is to first transfer partner to \Hs when you have an invitational hand. So you bid 2\D, and partner of course says 2\H. What do you bid next? 

You now show your second 5-card Major by bidding 2\S.

At this point partner becomes the Captain. You have described an invitational (9 point) hand with 5-5 in the Majors. Partner's next bid should set the contract wherever he chooses. In this case, with a maximum 1NT opener and 3 \Ss he picks 4\S.

Note that you must have at least one Major suit fit since partner cannot have a doubleton in both.}

{South opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

This is the sequel to Deal 6. You are 5-5 in the Majors again, but this time you have game forcing strength.

The preferred method for this hand is to transfer partner to \Ss, so you bid 2\H.

What do you bid after partner completes the transfer? 

You show your second 5-card Major by bidding 3\H. Since this shows game-forcing strength (11+ points) partner may not pass, but must bid either 4\H or 4\S. In this Deal he naturally bids 4\H.

If you held an even stronger hand and wished to move toward a slam you would start out the same way but then bid again after partner's game bid.}

[Result ""]
{South opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

Initiate the transfer by bidding 2\H. After partner responds 2\S what do you bid? 

Your bid of a minor suit here shows at least 4 cards and is a slam try. With a weaker hand you would probably just bid 2NT or 3NT.

Having made the try, you accept whatever partner decides. In this case, with a 15 point minimum, a doubleton \S and no \C fit, partner settles on 3NT.}
