1NT pass 2D 2S pass pass X pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\D. However, your Right Hand Opponent injects a 2\S overcall. What do you bid? 

It is usually correct to pass in this situation, particularly if you are not strong in partner's suit. So you pass and partner doubles.

What do you say now? 

Partner's double is called a Cooperative Double. It doesn't mean he has a \S stack, it just means that your side has the balance of power and South may have over-reached himself.

If you had good \Hs you might bid them now. Or, it is possible that you could make 3NT. But it is likely that you are going to make a bigger score in penalties so you pass.}
