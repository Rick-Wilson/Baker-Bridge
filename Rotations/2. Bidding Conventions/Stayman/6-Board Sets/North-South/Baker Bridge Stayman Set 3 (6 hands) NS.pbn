{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

With no 4-card Major you reply 2\D. What do you bid after partner next says 2NT? 

Partner seems to have about 9 points and is inviting you to say 3NT. Since you have a maximum 17 point hand you accept the invitation.}

{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

You bid 2\S. Partner next says 3\S. What do you say now? 

Considering the bidding you have done so far you couldn't have a worse hand. With 4-3-3-3 distribution and a bare 15 points you most certainly don't want to accept any invitation from partner. So you pass. As you see, 9 tricks are not going to come easily.}

{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

You respond 2\H. Partner now says 3\H. What do you bid? 

Partner has told you he has 4 \Hs and approximately 9 points. Add that to your 4 \Hs and 17 points and the total equals a game bid in \Hs. So you say 4\H.}

[Result ""]
{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

When you have 4 cards in both Majors you respond 2\H. Partner bids 2NT. What is your next bid? 

Partner would never bid Stayman without a 4-card Major. Since he did not like your \H bid it is clear that his 4-card Major must be \Ss. His 2NT bid was an invitation for you to bid 3NT, which means he has about 9 points. Knowing that partner has 9 points and 4 \Ss, your call is clear : 4\S.}

[Result ""]
{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

You do not have a 4-card Major. So your correct response is 2\D. Partner bids 2\H.  

Partner has described a hand with 4 \Ss and 5 \Hs. You don't know his strength but it must be at least 9 points. You know that you have just a 7-card fit in both Majors, and since you have a full 17 points you bid 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

Your 2\D response tells partner you have no 4-card Major suit. Then he bids 2\H. What do you say next? 

Partner knows you do not have 4 \Hs, but he bid the suit anyway. He must have 5 of them and he must also have 4 \Ss (since he used Stayman). But it's the \Hs you are interested in. Partner has 5 and you have 3. So you know of an 8-card Major suit fit. And you also know you have a maximum 1NT opening. So you say 4\H.}
