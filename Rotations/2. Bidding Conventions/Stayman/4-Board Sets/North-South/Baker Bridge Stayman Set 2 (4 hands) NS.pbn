{North opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

With 11 points and a 4-card Major suit you bid 2\C. Partner answers 2\S. What is your next bid? 

Stayman bidding can be very straightforward. Partner has 4 \Ss, you have 4 \Ss. That makes 8. Partner has 15-17 points, you have 11-12 points. That makes 26-29.

You bid 4\S.}

{South opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

You have a very big hand. Enormous. But you also have two 4-card Majors, so the first step is Stayman. You bid 2\C and partner replies 2\D. What do you bid next? 

You have 18 points and partner has 15, 16 or 17. Your total is between 33 and 35. You have enough POINTS for a small slam, not enough for a grand. You have no Major suit fit, and are happy to play notrump.

There is a lot to be said for bidding 6NT immediately. You could ask for Aces if you like but whether partner shows one or two isn't going to change your decision. Be bold.}

{North opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

You have another big hand. And with a 4-card Major you start with 2\C. Partner answers 2\H and it's your turn again. 

What with your singleton \S you certainly have enough points for slam. But since it's possible partner has only one Ace you check with Blackwood. Partner says 5\H and you say . . . What? 

Missing one Ace you bid 6\H.}

{South opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

This may go against your instincts, but if you're going to play Stayman then you should follow the rules. Granted that you have a great \S suit, you also have 4 \Hs. And when you have a 4-card Major you use Stayman. You bid 2\C and partner says 2\H.  

That is why you used Stayman - to uncover a 4-4 Major suit fit. Having done so you know that you will play in \Hs and you have enough points to bid game. You bid 4\H.}
