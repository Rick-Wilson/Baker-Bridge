{North opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

Yes, this is the same hand as Deal 8. Again you bid 2\CThis time partner says 2\D.  

You need to describe your hand clearly to partner with this bid. You want to show a game-forcing hand (11 points or more) with 4 \Hs and 5 \Ss. You do that by now jumping to 3\S.

If partner had just 2 \Ss he would have bid 3NT. Since he has 3 \Ss he bids 4\S.}

{Even when you hold a 6-card Major, if you have 4 cards in the other Major you use Stayman. Partner answers 2\S. What do you bid? 

You've found an 8-card Major fit and you know there are enough points for game. So you bid 4\S.

Yes, but you already knew you had an 8-card \H fit since partner's 1NT promised at least 2 \Hs. In fact, you could play game in either Major. However, it is often better to play in a 4-4 fit rather than a 5-3 or 6-2. This hand shows why. Played in \Hs you will make exactly T tricks with any opening lead. Played in \Ss you will again make T tricks when the defenders start with their 3 \C winners. If they start with anything else you are very likely to make 1 or 2 overtricks by discarding dummy losers on your \H suit.}

{This is the follow-up to Deal T. North opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

Just like the previous deal with a 4-card Major you use Stayman. This time partner says 2\D. Your turn again. 

With partner showing no 4-card Major the bidding takes a turn. With your 6 \Hs you are sure of an 8-card fit in the suit. With 11 points you must be sure of reaching game. So you bid 4\H.

In this case the strong hand does not become declarer, but the contract is the right one anyway.}

{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

Partner has commanded you to bid a 4-card Major if you have one. You have one, so you bid 2\S. Partner now says 2NT. What do you bid? 

Partner evidently has 4 \Hs. He also evidently has about 9 points since he is INVITING you to bid 3NT. With your minimum 15 points you decline the invitation by passing.}
