{South opens 1NT and West overcalls 2\D. What do you say? 

Dad-burned interfering opponents. You were going to bid a Stayman 2\C and now you can't. You also don't want to bid either Major with only 4 of them. And you certainly can't bid notrump with no \D stopper. Fortunately the overcall has opened a window of opportunity for you. So you cue-bid 3\D. Even if you and partner haven't discussed this it is pretty obvious that you don't really want to play in \Ds, so the most likely action for him is to bid a suit, and a Major suit would have priority. So really, the cue-bid achieves the same purpose as Stayman would have.

Partner now bids 3\H. What do you say? 

Partner showed a 4-card \H suit. With your 4 that makes a fit. You have 12 revalued points so you bid 4\H.}
