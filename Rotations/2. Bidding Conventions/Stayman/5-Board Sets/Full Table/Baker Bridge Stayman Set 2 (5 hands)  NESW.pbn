{North opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

You have a very big hand. Enormous. But you also have two 4-card Majors, so the first step is Stayman. You bid 2\C and partner replies 2\D. What do you bid next? 

You have 18 points and partner has 15, 16 or 17. Your total is between 33 and 35. You have enough POINTS for a small slam, not enough for a grand. You have no Major suit fit, and are happy to play notrump.

There is a lot to be said for bidding 6NT immediately. You could ask for Aces if you like but whether partner shows one or two isn't going to change your decision. Be bold.}

{East opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

You have another big hand. And with a 4-card Major you start with 2\C. Partner answers 2\H and it's your turn again. 

What with your singleton \S you certainly have enough points for slam. But since it's possible partner has only one Ace you check with Blackwood. Partner says 5\H and you say . . . What? 

Missing one Ace you bid 6\H.}

{South opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

This may go against your instincts, but if you're going to play Stayman then you should follow the rules. Granted that you have a great \S suit, you also have 4 \Hs. And when you have a 4-card Major you use Stayman. You bid 2\C and partner says 2\H.  

That is why you used Stayman - to uncover a 4-4 Major suit fit. Having done so you know that you will play in \Hs and you have enough points to bid game. You bid 4\H.}

{East opens 1NT. What do you respond? 

Yes, this is the same hand as Deal 8. Again you bid 2\CThis time partner says 2\D.  

You need to describe your hand clearly to partner with this bid. You want to show a game-forcing hand (11 points or more) with 4 \Hs and 5 \Ss. You do that by now jumping to 3\S.

If partner had just 2 \Ss he would have bid 3NT. Since he has 3 \Ss he bids 4\S.}

[Result ""]
{Even when you hold a 6-card Major, if you have 4 cards in the other Major you use Stayman. Partner answers 2\S. What do you bid? 

You've found an 8-card Major fit and you know there are enough points for game. So you bid 4\S.

Yes, but you already knew you had an 8-card \H fit since partner's 1NT promised at least 2 \Hs. In fact, you could play game in either Major. However, it is often better to play in a 4-4 fit rather than a 5-3 or 6-2. This hand shows why. Played in \Hs you will make exactly T tricks with any opening lead. Played in \Ss you will again make T tricks when the defenders start with their 3 \C winners. If they start with anything else you are very likely to make 1 or 2 overtricks by discarding dummy losers on your \H suit.}
