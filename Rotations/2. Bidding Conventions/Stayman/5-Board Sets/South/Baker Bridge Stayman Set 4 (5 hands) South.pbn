{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

When you have 4 cards in both Majors you respond 2\H. Partner bids 2NT. What is your next bid? 

Partner would never bid Stayman without a 4-card Major. Since he did not like your \H bid it is clear that his 4-card Major must be \Ss. His 2NT bid was an invitation for you to bid 3NT, which means he has about 9 points. Knowing that partner has 9 points and 4 \Ss, your call is clear : 4\S.}

{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

You do not have a 4-card Major. So your correct response is 2\D. Partner bids 2\H.  

Partner has described a hand with 4 \Ss and 5 \Hs. You don't know his strength but it must be at least 9 points. You know that you have just a 7-card fit in both Majors, and since you have a full 17 points you bid 3NT.}

{You open 1NT and partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

Your 2\D response tells partner you have no 4-card Major suit. Then he bids 2\H. What do you say next? 

Partner knows you do not have 4 \Hs, but he bid the suit anyway. He must have 5 of them and he must also have 4 \Ss (since he used Stayman). But it's the \Hs you are interested in. Partner has 5 and you have 3. So you know of an 8-card Major suit fit. And you also know you have a maximum 1NT opening. So you say 4\H.}

{With a balanced 20 points you open 2NT and partner responds 3\C. What do you bid? 

Stayman applies after a 2NT opening, just one level higher. With no 4-card Major you bid 3\D. Partner next bids 3\S. What do you bid? 

Partner is showing 5 \Ss and 4 \Hs. In neither case would you have the 8-card fit you need. So you bid 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{You open 2NT and partner responds 3\C. What do you bid? 

With 4 cards in each Major suit you bid 3\H. Partner puts you in 3NT. What do you do? Pass or bid? 

You certainly do not pass. Partner's Stayman bid tells you he has a 4-card Major suit. His 3NT bid tells you the suit was not \Hs. Elementary, Watson, the suit must be \Ss. So you convert the 3NT bid to 4\S.

If you want to make yourself happy you use Stayman, just imagine playing 3NT after a \C lead!}
