{You would really love to pass. You have a terrible hand and you like the \Ds better than the \Cs.

But you are forced to bid. And since partner has 5 \Cs and only 4 \Ds, you should take him back to his first suit.

Mercifully he passes.}

{When partner shows 17+ points with his Reverse you are sure you belong in game. Since he did not support your \Ss you know he doesn't have four of them. You also know you have an 8-card fit in \Ds, but surely nine tricks in Notrump will be easier than eleven in \Ds.}

{With 17 points you have a perfect hand for a Reverse. So you bid 2\D. Partner then says 3\C. What do you say? 

Partner's return to your \C suit shows he has fewer than 9 points. Although it is possible to devise a hand for him where your side could make 3NT, the risk is too great.

So you pass. It's a good thing, too.}

{You have an ideal hand for a Reverse, so you bid 2\H.

Partner now bids 3\D. What do you say? 

Partner has a minimum hand, but at least he came up with a preference for \Ds.

There are no guarantees here, but you should probably try 5\D.}

{With 18 points you have enough to make a Reverse. So you bid 2\D. Partner now says 3\S. What do you bid? 

Partner's jump bid shows a 6-card suit and enough points to insist on game. With your \H stopper you might be considering 3NT, but since you know of an 8-card \S fit you decide on 4\S.

Be very glad that you did.3NT would go down with a \H opening lead while 4\S is cold.}
