{If you thought you couldn't bid 1\S because it would have been a Reverse just think again.

A Reverse is when you bid a higher-ranking second suit at the 2-level. This is just normal bidding of suits up the line.

Partner now takes control and bids the \S game.}

{At your first turn you bid your \H suit, up-the-line. Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

You only have 7 points, but partner Reversed so you cannot pass. You need to make a bid to show your minimum, and you cannot support either of partner's suits, nor can you rebid your \Hs.

However, you also cannot bid your \S suit. That would be fourth-suit-forcing, and would show a game forcing hand of 9 or more points.

Instead you bid 2NT. Partner has a bare 17 so he passes.}

You could fall back on the guidelines and say that with 10 points you need to make a positive bid at this time, but it is simpler to just rely on "SHE WHO KNOWS, GOES."

Since you know of an 8-card \H fit and at least 27 points you bid 4\H.}

{You are the dealer.  

It may be tempting to open 1\H, planning on Reversing in \S at your second turn to show your big hand.

Don't. A Reverse should always show an unbalanced hand with the first suit longer. So you open 1\S and partner replies 2\S.

What do you bid? 

If you had opened 1\H partner would have replied 1NT. Then when you Reversed with 2\S he would have assumed you had a 4-card \S suit and would probably have put you back in \Hs, your known 5-card suit.

Things would have gotten confusing, to say the least.}

Partner's return to your \C suit shows he has fewer than 9 points. Although it is possible to devise a hand for him where your side could make 3NT, the risk is too great.

So you pass. It's a good thing, too.}
