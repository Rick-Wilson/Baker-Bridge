{With his Reverse, partner has shown at least 17 points and at least 4 \Hs.

You could fall back on the guidelines and say that with 10 points you need to make a positive bid at this time, but it is simpler to just rely on "SHE WHO KNOWS, GOES."

Since you know of an 8-card \H fit and at least 27 points you bid 4\H.}

{You are the dealer.  

It may be tempting to open 1\H, planning on Reversing in \S at your second turn to show your big hand.

Don't. A Reverse should always show an unbalanced hand with the first suit longer. So you open 1\S and partner replies 2\S.

What do you bid? 

If you had opened 1\H partner would have replied 1NT. Then when you Reversed with 2\S he would have assumed you had a 4-card \S suit and would probably have put you back in \Hs, your known 5-card suit.

Things would have gotten confusing, to say the least.}

{You would really love to pass. You have a terrible hand and you like the \Ds better than the \Cs.

But you are forced to bid. And since partner has 5 \Cs and only 4 \Ds, you should take him back to his first suit.

Mercifully he passes.}

{When partner shows 17+ points with his Reverse you are sure you belong in game. Since he did not support your \Ss you know he doesn't have four of them. You also know you have an 8-card fit in \Ds, but surely nine tricks in Notrump will be easier than eleven in \Ds.}
