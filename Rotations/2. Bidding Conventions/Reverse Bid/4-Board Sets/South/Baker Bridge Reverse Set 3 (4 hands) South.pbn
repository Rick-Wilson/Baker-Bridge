{With 17 points you have a perfect hand for a Reverse. So you bid 2\D. Partner then says 3\C. What do you say? 

Partner's return to your \C suit shows he has fewer than 9 points. Although it is possible to devise a hand for him where your side could make 3NT, the risk is too great.

So you pass. It's a good thing, too.}

{You have an ideal hand for a Reverse, so you bid 2\H.

Partner now bids 3\D. What do you say? 

Partner has a minimum hand, but at least he came up with a preference for \Ds.

There are no guarantees here, but you should probably try 5\D.}

[Result ""]
{With 18 points you have enough to make a Reverse. So you bid 2\D. Partner now says 3\S. What do you bid? 

Partner's jump bid shows a 6-card suit and enough points to insist on game. With your \H stopper you might be considering 3NT, but since you know of an 8-card \S fit you decide on 4\S.

Be very glad that you did.3NT would go down with a \H opening lead while 4\S is cold.}
