{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

A perfect Michaels example; 5-5 in the Majors and 9 points. You bid 2\D and partner says 2\S. What do you bid next? 

You have a rather minimum Michaels type hand and you asked partner to choose a Major suit. He chose \Ss. But don't start thinking about what great support you have for his \S suit, he doesn't HAVE a \S suit, he is just supporting yours. In other words, you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You have a fair hand with a guaranteed 8-card fit in either Major. You are not, however, strong enough to jump the bidding. So you bid 2\H, which is passed out.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You have a pretty good hand for an Unusual Notrump, but not so good that you wouldn't use the convention. You bid 2NT and partner says 3\C. What do you say next? 

As mentioned, you have a pretty good hand, but partner only bid because you forced him to and he showed nothing more than minimum. So you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Your best suit is \Hs. But partner didn't ask you to bid \Hs, he asked you to pick a Minor. You know you will have an 8-card fit in \Ds so you take the safe approach and bid 3\D. Everybody passes.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Of course you bid a Michaels Cue-Bid of 2\S. Partner says 4\H.  

Partner's jump might indicate he has a really good hand, or he might just have a really good fit. You certainly don't have the strength to make another move so you pass. A good thing, too. Partner might get lucky and make this but it looks like the other guys are cold for 4\S. Even if partner loses 2 \H tricks and goes down 1 it will turn out to be a good sacrifice.}
