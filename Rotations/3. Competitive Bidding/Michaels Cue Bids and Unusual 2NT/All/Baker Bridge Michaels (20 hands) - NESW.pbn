{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

A perfect Michaels example; 5-5 in the Majors and 9 points. You bid 2\D and partner says 2\S. What do you bid next? 

You have a rather minimum Michaels type hand and you asked partner to choose a Major suit. He chose \Ss. But don't start thinking about what great support you have for his \S suit, he doesn't HAVE a \S suit, he is just supporting yours. In other words, you pass.}

Of course you bid a Michaels Cue-Bid of 2\S. Partner says 4\H.  

Partner's jump might indicate he has a really good hand, or he might just have a really good fit. You certainly don't have the strength to make another move so you pass. A good thing, too. Partner might get lucky and make this but it looks like the other guys are cold for 4\S. Even if partner loses 2 \H tricks and goes down 1 it will turn out to be a good sacrifice.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With the two lowest unbid suits you bid 2NT. Partner jumps to 4\D. What do you bid? 

Partner probably has a good hand, but he might just be preempting. Assuming he is inviting you to bid game you have a tough decision. You are not very strong but you might have been a couple of points weaker. It is strictly a judgement call and we decide to pass.

As you can see, IF they open the lead with a \C, and IF the \H finesse then works, you can make 5\D.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

As you have figured out by now, using Michaels Cue-Bids / Unusual Notrump is sometimes hard to tie down. Here you have 13/14 points and if you figure partner for 9 that won't be enough for game. But, those two Minor Aces are worth a lot when you figure partner has only 3 Minor suit cards.

So let's say you decide to just invite with 3\S. Partner takes you to game.

You will surely make this game if trumps split 2-2. If they don't then you will have to hope for a defensive mistake.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With 5 cards in the "other" Major and a 5-card Minor suit this looks like an ideal Michaels Cue-Bid, right? No, not really. While it would not be a capital offense to bid 2\H here, it generally works out better with 13-16 point hands to just overcall in your higher-ranking suit. You bid 1\S. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid? 

Partner's cue-bid shows a limit-raise or better in \Ss. So you bid 4\S without the blink of an eye.}

Yes, you have a high-level Michaels hand but don't get carried away. Remember that you forced partner to bid. Any bid at all by you at this point will show 17+ points, so you just raise to 3\H. Partner has a weak hand and passes.}
