{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With 18 points and 5-5 Major suits you are up in the high-level Michaels category. You bid 2\D and partner responds 2\H. What do you bid next? 

Yes, you have a high-level Michaels hand but don't get carried away. Remember that you forced partner to bid. Any bid at all by you at this point will show 17+ points, so you just raise to 3\H. Partner has a weak hand and passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Partner wants you to bid \Hs or \Ds. You figure that in either of the red suits you will have a 7-card fit. You hope to do better than that in \Ss. So you bid 3\S and everybody passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You have 20 points and two good 5-card Majors so you bid a Michaels 2\C. Partner responds 2\S. What do you say next? 

Partner may have as few as zero points and as many as 13 or so. You COULD bid an invitational 3\S, but if he has only 5 or 6 points he will pass. Looking at your hand you only need to find partner with \S J x x to have a good shot at game. So go ahead and bid 4\S.

Will you look at that. Partner has only 2 points, but what great ones to have!}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Partner has 5 of each Major suit so you know of a good 9-card \H fit. You have a nice hand and must decide between inviting with 3\H or bidding the game on your own. You decide to bid the game so you say 4\H and everybody passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

This is a really good hand for Unusual Notrump. You bid 2NT and partner says 3\S. What do you say now? 

Partner apparently has a big hand. His cue-bid is forcing, and probably means he wants to be in game. But for now you can just show your minimum strength and give a suit preference. You bid 4\C and partner raises to 5\C.}

Many times at Bridge you want to fight for the contract. This isn't one of them. With 6 HCP and only four cards total in partner's two suits just let the opponents have it. You pass.}
