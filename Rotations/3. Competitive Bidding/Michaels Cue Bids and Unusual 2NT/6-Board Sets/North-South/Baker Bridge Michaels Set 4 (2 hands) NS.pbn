{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With two 5-card Majors of course you bid 2\D. Partner responds 3\C. What do you say now? 

This wasn't according to your script. Partner was supposed to choose a Major. The reason he didn't, of course, is that he didn't like either one and figured you would be better in \Cs. So you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You don't have a great hand but you DO have 4 \Ss. So don't let the opponents have a 3-level contract when your side has 9 \Ss. Bid 3\S.

Note: See the Law of Total Tricks Lesson on this topic.}
