{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With 5 cards in the "other" Major and a 5-card Minor you bid 2\S, Michaels of course. Partner bids 2NT. What do you say next? 

Is it possible that partner wants to play Notrump? Not at all. He hates \Hs and wants you to bid your Minor suit. So you say 3\D and he passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Partner asked you to choose between \Hs and \Ds so you bid 3\D. He then raises you to 4\D. What do you bid? 

If you say to yourself "I only have 7 HCP" then you might pass. But if you say "Partner invited me to bid game, even though I might have no points and only 3 trumps. I'm a lot better than that.", then you will accept the invitation. So you bid 5\D and everybody passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With 5 cards in the "other" Major and a 5-card Minor suit this looks like an ideal Michaels Cue-Bid, right? No, not really. While it would not be a capital offense to bid 2\H here, it generally works out better with 13-16 point hands to just overcall in your higher-ranking suit. You bid 1\S. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid? 

Partner's cue-bid shows a limit-raise or better in \Ss. So you bid 4\S without the blink of an eye.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Partner is 5-5 in \Ss and one of the Minor suits. Forget \Ss, you want him to bid the Minor. So you bid 2NT. Partner says 3\C.  

Partner only made a minimum bid, so you have no choice but to pass.}
