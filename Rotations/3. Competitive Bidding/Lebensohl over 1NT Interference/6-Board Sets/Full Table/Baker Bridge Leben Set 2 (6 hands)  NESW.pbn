{With your hand you'd like to sign off in 3\D. But you cannot actually bid 3\D because that would show a forcing-to-game hand. So you bid a lebensohl 2NT.

Partner makes the relay bid of 3\C. What do you say? 

NOW you can bid 3\D, which partner passes.}

How about . . . . pass? Partner just signed off with this sequence. He couldn't bid 3\H directly, that would have been a game-force.}

Partner says 4\H and you pass.}

NOW you cue-bid 3\S. This is Stayman, but with a \S stopper, (SLOW SHOWS). Partner says 3NT and you pass.}

He next says 3\D.  

Partner has just described a hand with which he wants to play in game, which has at least one 4-card Major suit, and has \Ds stopped. He wants you to pick the game.

With no 4-card Major of your own, you pick 3NT.}
