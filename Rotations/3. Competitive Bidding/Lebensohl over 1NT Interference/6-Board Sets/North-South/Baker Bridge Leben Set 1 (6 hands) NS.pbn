{This is a sign-off hand. If West hadn't bid you would either have bid 2\S, which partner would have passed, or 2\H, transferring partner to 2\S which YOU would have passed.

With lebensohl you can do the same thing, so you bid 2\S and partner passes.}

Partner has 3-card support and is happy to bid game in that suit.}

{With 11 points opposite partner's 15-17, this is a forcing-to-game hand, and it is possible that a jump to 3NT (which says you have no \C stopper) would work. However, with two 4-card Major suits you should use the lebensohl equivalent of Stayman, which is a cue-bid of 3\C.

Partner bids 3\H. What do you say? 

With a known 8-card Major fit and a known 26-28 points you bid 4\H.}
