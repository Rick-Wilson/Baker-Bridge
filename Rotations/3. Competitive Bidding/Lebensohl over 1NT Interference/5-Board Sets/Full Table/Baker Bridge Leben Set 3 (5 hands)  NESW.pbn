{With your 12 point hand you need to force to game. It would also be nice to find out if partner has a 4-card \H suit. Since you have East's \S suit stopped, you first bid a lebensohl 2NT.

Partner says 3\C. What do you bid? 

NOW you cue-bid 3\S. This is Stayman, but with a \S stopper, (SLOW SHOWS). Partner says 3NT and you pass.}

{Partner's 2NT bid requests that you bid 3\C, so you do.

He next says 3\D.  

Partner has just described a hand with which he wants to play in game, which has at least one 4-card Major suit, and has \Ds stopped. He wants you to pick the game.

With no 4-card Major of your own, you pick 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{With 12 points opposite partner's 15-17, this is a forcing-to-game hand. If it had not been for the \H overcall you would just have jumped to 3NT. 

Playing lebensohl you do the same thing, jump to 3NT. Since you went directly to 3NT you are telling partner you have that type of hand, but DO NOT have a \H stopper (DIRECT DENIES).

Partner does have them stopped so he passes.}

[Result ""]
{With your 12 point balanced hand you know you are going to play in game. Since you have no interest in looking for a 4-4 Major suit fit you also know that game is going to be 3NT. But you can't actually BID 3NT, because partner would almost surely take you out to a minor suit. Remember, a DIRECT 3NT bid DENIES a stopper in their suit. Since you have East's \S suit stopped, you first bid a lebensohl 2NT.

Partner says 3\C. What do you bid? 

You now complete the picture of your hand by bidding 3NT. (SLOW SHOWS). Partner passes.}
