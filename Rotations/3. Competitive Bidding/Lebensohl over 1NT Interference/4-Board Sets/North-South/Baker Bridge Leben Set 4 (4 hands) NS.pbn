{With 12 points opposite partner's 15-17, this is a forcing-to-game hand. If it had not been for the \H overcall you would just have jumped to 3NT. 

Playing lebensohl you do the same thing, jump to 3NT. Since you went directly to 3NT you are telling partner you have that type of hand, but DO NOT have a \H stopper (DIRECT DENIES).

Partner does have them stopped so he passes.}

{Partner's 2NT bid requests that you bid 3\C, so you do.

He next says 3NT.  

Partner's bidding shows a hand with which he would have bid 3NT without the overcall. Furthermore, he promises a \H stopper. He expects you to pass, so you do.}

[Result ""]
{With your 12 point balanced hand you know you are going to play in game. Since you have no interest in looking for a 4-4 Major suit fit you also know that game is going to be 3NT. But you can't actually BID 3NT, because partner would almost surely take you out to a minor suit. Remember, a DIRECT 3NT bid DENIES a stopper in their suit. Since you have East's \S suit stopped, you first bid a lebensohl 2NT.

Partner says 3\C. What do you bid? 

You now complete the picture of your hand by bidding 3NT. (SLOW SHOWS). Partner passes.}
