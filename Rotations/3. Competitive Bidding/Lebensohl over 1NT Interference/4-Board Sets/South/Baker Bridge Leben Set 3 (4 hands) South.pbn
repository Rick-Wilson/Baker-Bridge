{With your 12 point hand you need to force to game. It would also be nice to find out if partner has a 4-card \H suit. So you cue-bid 3\S. This is the lebensohl version of Stayman, but WITH NO \S STOPPER. (Direct Denies)

Partner says 4\H and you pass.}

{With your 12 point hand you need to force to game. It would also be nice to find out if partner has a 4-card \H suit. Since you have West's \S suit stopped, you first bid a lebensohl 2NT.

Partner says 3\C. What do you bid? 

NOW you cue-bid 3\S. This is Stayman, but with a \S stopper, (SLOW SHOWS). Partner says 3NT and you pass.}

{Partner's 2NT bid requests that you bid 3\C, so you do.

He next says 3\D.  

Partner has just described a hand with which he wants to play in game, which has at least one 4-card Major suit, and has \Ds stopped. He wants you to pick the game.

With no 4-card Major of your own, you pick 3NT.}
