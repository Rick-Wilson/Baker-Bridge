{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

If you had been the dealer you would have opened 2\S. The situation is no different after they open so you Overcall 2\S. Everybody passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You don't like to take partner out of his overcalled suit without good reason. Here you have good reason. So you bid 1\S. Partner replies 2\S. What do you say next? 

You expect partner to have three trumps, but he has made a minimum bid. So you take the conservative route and pass.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

You have a nice easy decision here. You overcall 1\H. Then partner bids 1\S. What do you say next? 

Whether you play a change of suit as forcing or not, your hand certainly qualifies as one where you should make a bid. Partner doesn't really like your \Hs but you are quite satisfied to play in \Ss. So you bid 2\S. Partner jumps to 4\S and that closes out the auction.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You treat partner's 1NT Overcall the same as a 1NT Opening. You use Stayman and bid 2\C. Partner replies 2\H. What is your next bid? 

You have 9 points, an invitational strength hand. You bid 3\H, inviting partner to go to game with a maximum. He declines your invitation.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

You have a sound 2-level overcall. You bid 2\C and partner replies 2\S. What is your next bid? 

Partner's cue-bid obviously forces you to bid. Partner's hand might be very distributional, but rather than just sticking to \Cs you suggest with 2NT. This guarantees you have \Ss stopped. Partner likes your suggestion and bids 3NT.}

Balanced hand, poor support for partner's suit, stoppers in their suit and 13 points. You couldn't get a better hand to jump to 2NT. Partner takes you to 3NT.}
