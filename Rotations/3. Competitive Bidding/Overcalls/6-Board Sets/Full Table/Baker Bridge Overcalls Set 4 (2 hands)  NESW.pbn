{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

With a good 6-card suit and 10 points you make a Weak Jump Overcall to 2\D. Partner says 2NT.  

The 2NT bid is a standard response to a Weak 2-bid. It asks for the identification of any outside high-card if the Weak 2-bidder has more than a minimum. Here you are in the top range for your bid so you show your \HK.

That was apparently the missing link for partner, he now says 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You might just try 4\S. Of course if partner has a minimum Weak Jump Overcall that will get you much too high. A better approach is to ask for more information from partner. The bid that asks is 2NT. Partner replies 3\D.  

Partner's 3\D bid tells you two things. One, he is in the top half of his 6-11 point range. Two, he has a high card (Ace or King) in \Ds. When you construct a hand for him which contains 6 pretty good \Ss and the \DA you come up with a hand which will probably make game. Bid 4\S.}
