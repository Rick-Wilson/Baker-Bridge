{The bidding has been as shown. It is your turn. Decide what you would say, then  on "" above. 

You have 14 points but so what. You have no 5-card suit to Overcall. You cannot make a Takeout Double with 4 of their suit. So you pass. It is important to realize that there are hands you would open but cannot overcall with.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With four trumps and 12 points you have a text-book raise to 3\H. Partner had a minimum overcall though, so he passed.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

With 12 points and a good suit you have a very solid overcall so you bid 1\H. Partner responds 2\H. What do you say? 

Partner is showing 6-10 points and three trumps. Your hand revalues to 14 at most so you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You really don't like partner's \Ss, and you do have 8 points. But 8 points is not enough to be considering game, and you would have to bid your \Hs at the 2-level. All things considered it is better to pass while you still aren't doubled.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

You overcall 2\H and hear partner raise you to 3\H. What do you say now? 

No matter how many times you check this hand you cannot revalue it any more than 13 points. Since partner has T at the most you reluctantly pass.}
