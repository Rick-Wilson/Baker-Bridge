{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You treat partner's 1NT Overcall the same as a 1NT Opening. You use Stayman and bid 2\C. Partner replies 2\H. What is your next bid? 

You have 9 points, an invitational strength hand. You bid 3\H, inviting partner to go to game with a maximum. He declines your invitation.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

You have a sound 2-level overcall. You bid 2\C and partner replies 2\S. What is your next bid? 

Partner's cue-bid obviously forces you to bid. Partner's hand might be very distributional, but rather than just sticking to \Cs you suggest with 2NT. This guarantees you have \Ss stopped. Partner likes your suggestion and bids 3NT.}

Balanced hand, poor support for partner's suit, stoppers in their suit and 13 points. You couldn't get a better hand to jump to 2NT. Partner takes you to 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

With a good 6-card suit and 10 points you make a Weak Jump Overcall to 2\D. Partner says 2NT.  

The 2NT bid is a standard response to a Weak 2-bid. It asks for the identification of any outside high-card if the Weak 2-bidder has more than a minimum. Here you are in the top range for your bid so you show your \HK.

That was apparently the missing link for partner, he now says 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You might just try 4\S. Of course if partner has a minimum Weak Jump Overcall that will get you much too high. A better approach is to ask for more information from partner. The bid that asks is 2NT. Partner replies 3\D.  

Partner's 3\D bid tells you two things. One, he is in the top half of his 6-11 point range. Two, he has a high card (Ace or King) in \Ds. When you construct a hand for him which contains 6 pretty good \Ss and the \DA you come up with a hand which will probably make game. Bid 4\S.}
