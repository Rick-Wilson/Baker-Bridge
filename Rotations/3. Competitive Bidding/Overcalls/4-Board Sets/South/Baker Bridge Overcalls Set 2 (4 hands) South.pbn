{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

You overcall 2\H and hear partner raise you to 3\H. What do you say now? 

No matter how many times you check this hand you cannot revalue it any more than 13 points. Since partner has T at the most you reluctantly pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With only 7 points you might not think you have enough to make a "free bid". But in competitive bidding situations like these, where both sides have a fit, bidding is usually better than passing. So you bid 2\S.

You might look at the Law of Total Tricks lesson for more on this subject.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

You have enough for a 1-level Overcall so you bid 1\S. Partner says 3\S. What do you say now? 

The jump raise tells you partner has 11-14 points.

With your minimum it's going to have to be better than that to get you excited. So you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You have 10 points, but in cases like this points don't matter that much. They MIGHT be able to make 4\H. Partner MIGHT be able to make 4\S. This preemptive jump takes the decision away from them.

Looking at the hands you can see that partner is going to go down 1 at 4\S. However, that is an excellent result since they appear to be cold for 5\H.}
