{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With only 7 points you might not think you have enough to make a "free bid". But in competitive bidding situations like these, where both sides have a fit, bidding is usually better than passing. So you bid 2\S.

You might look at the Law of Total Tricks lesson for more on this subject.}

You have 10 points, but in cases like this points don't matter that much. They MIGHT be able to make 4\H. Partner MIGHT be able to make 4\S. This preemptive jump takes the decision away from them.

Looking at the hands you can see that partner is going to go down 1 at 4\S. However, that is an excellent result since they appear to be cold for 5\H.}

This hand would be one point too strong to Open 1NT, but it fits the 15-18 range to Overcall 1NT. Partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

Don't get your systems crossed. Partner did not make a cue-bid, he is using Stayman. Since you have no 4-card Major suit you answer 2\D. Partner now says 2NT and the ball is in your court. 

This is just a plain old 1NT/Stayman sequence. Partner is inviting, and since you have 18 points you accept.}

With a good 6-card suit and 10 points you make a Weak Jump Overcall to 2\D. Partner says 2NT.  

The 2NT bid is a standard response to a Weak 2-bid. It asks for the identification of any outside high-card if the Weak 2-bidder has more than a minimum. Here you are in the top range for your bid so you show your \HK.

That was apparently the missing link for partner, he now says 3NT.}

You might just try 4\S. Of course if partner has a minimum Weak Jump Overcall that will get you much too high. A better approach is to ask for more information from partner. The bid that asks is 2NT. Partner replies 3\D.  

Partner's 3\D bid tells you two things. One, he is in the top half of his 6-11 point range. Two, he has a high card (Ace or King) in \Ds. When you construct a hand for him which contains 6 pretty good \Ss and the \DA you come up with a hand which will probably make game. Bid 4\S.}
