{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Pretty good hand you have. Certainly good enough to make a Takeout Double that forces partner to the 3-level. Partner responds 3\H. What do you bid? 

Some questions don't have a correct answer. If partner has \H Q x x x along with the \CK and \DQ he would bid just as he did and slam would be cold. But if he has four small \Hs and nothing else he would bid just as he did and you probably cannot make ten tricks. On balance it is probably best to just bid the most likely reasonable contract, which is 4\H.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You have a perfect 2NT opening hand. Trouble is, the opponents have already opened. You get around that problem by first making a Takeout Double. Partner replies 1\S.  

You could not say 1NT on your first bid because that would show 15-18 points. Doubling first, then bidding the lowest level of notrump shows 19-20 points. Of course in both cases you must have their suit adequately stopped. Partner does the math and bids 3NT.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You double and partner responds 1\D. What do you bid next? 

The pattern continues. Overcall 1NT with 15-18. Double, then bid notrump with 19-20. Double then jump in notrump with 21-22. So you jump to 2NT. Partner puts it to 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You have no choice. You absolutely may not pass. So you say 1\S. Partner now bids 2\S. What do you say? 

Partner obviously has a good hand. Your response showed 0-8 points and he still found enough strength to invite you to bid game. However, with your 4-point square hand you must decline the invitation.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With 7 points you must make a minimum response. Even though \Cs is your best suit you should prefer to show a 4-card Major. So you bid 1\S. Partner raises to 2\S and it is your turn to bid. 

Your first response showed 0-8 points. Knowing that, partner still invited you to go on if you were at the high end of the range. With 7 HCP and a doubleton you are right at the maximum for your bid, so you bid 4\S.}
