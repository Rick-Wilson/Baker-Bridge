{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Partner has indicated a 4-card \S suit. Since you also have 4 you will naturally bid them. However, with the \S fit your hand revalues to 17 points. So you jump to 2\S. Partner bids the game.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With 13 points and 4 of the "other" Major you make a Negative Double. Partner's rebid is 2\H. What is your next bid? 

Partner has 4 \Hs and an opening hand. You have 4 \Hs and an opening hand. That adds up to a game bid and an 8-card \H fit. You bid 4\H.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Partner's Negative Double in this situation shows both Majors. You can't support either Major but with 18 points and good \D stoppers you jump to 2NT. Partner bids 3NT and everybody passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

If you bid 1\S now it would be showing a 5-card \S suit. So instead you make a Negative Double. Partner jumps to 2\S. What do you bid? 

Partner's jump shows a Medium hand, 16 - 18 points. Add your 11 and you have enough for game so you bid it.}
