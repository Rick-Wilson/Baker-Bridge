{With T HCP and a solid 6-card suit this is an ideal DONT bid. You double and partner follows procedure by saying 2\C.

Now you follow procedure by showing your 6-card suit. You bid 2\H and everybody passes.}

{Partner's double asks you to bid 2\C as a relay bid so he can name his suit.

But you don't want him to bid his 6-card suit, your hand is useless unless \Ss are trumps. So ignore the relay request and bid 2\S. Everybody passes.}

{In the balancing seat it is distribution that counts, not point count. With a 6-card Major suit and a singleton you should not let them play 1NT. Youdouble.

Partner makes the relay bid of 2\C.  

You bid your suit, 2\H, and everybody passes. Notice that partner had a decent hand, but could not bid over 1NT in the immediate seat.}

{You don't have a 6-card suit, nor do you have a 5-4 pair of suits. So even with a singleton you don't want to use DONT here. So you pass.

Partner makes a DONT double in the balancing seat.  

Right now you probably have a premonition about what is going to happen next. But there really is nothing you can say other than 2\C.

Your premonition came true. Partner passes and you are left playing 2\C with a singleton. Nobody promised that DONT would always get you to a good contract.}
