1NT pass pass 2S pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{Would you really bid over 1NT with only 5 HCP? In the balancing seat you should. Partner is marked with a pretty good hand, and you have a 6-card Major suit.

You do bid just 2\S though, rather than a double followed by 2\S, which would show a stronger hand. Everybody passes.}

1NT pass pass 2H pass 2S pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{You would have opened 1\D but after East opens 1NT you must pass.

Partner bids 2\H in the balancing seat.  

The 2\H bid shows \Hs and \Ss.

You have absolutely no preference between the two suits. But you do have a preference as to where the opening lead will be coming from - you'd like West to have to lead through East's strength. Besides you feel like playing the last hand so you say 2\S and everybody passes.}
