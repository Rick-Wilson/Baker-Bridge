{When you have a weak, distributional hand with 5 of partner's suit an immediate jump to game is usually the best approach. If he has a good hand you will probably make the contract. If he is minimum then you might get a preemptive effect and stop your LHO from entering the bidding.

This is a good example. Partner may be lucky and make 4\H. But if they had had an opportunity to compete the opponents might well be able to make 4\S.}

{You can't support partner's \Hs with only 2 of them so you bid your nice \S suit. Partner then jumps to 3\H. Now what do you bid? 

Here's where a lot of players go wrong. Since they only promised 4 \Ss with their first response they think they should now rebid them to show partner they had 5. And this MIGHT work if it turns out partner has 3 \Ss. Not only is this a risky bid, it is unnecessary. When partner jump rebid \Hs he showed 16-18 points and 6 \Hs. So you know of an 8-card fit and you know you should be in game. Bid 4\H.}
