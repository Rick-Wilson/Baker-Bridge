{You dealt the hand. Decide what you would say, then  on BID in the bidding section above. 

With 13 points and a nice 5-card Major suit you open 1\H. Partner responds 2\H. What do you say next? 

You say pass. You have a minimum opening hand and partner has 6-10 points so no game is available.}

{Nice hand. 19 points and a good 5-card Major. You open 1\H. Partner responds 2\H. What is your next bid? 

You revalue to 20 points (doubleton \S) and partner has between 6 and T. So, 26 to 30 is the total. Game should be there, but slam is out of reach. So you bid 4\H.}

{With 15 points and a 5-card Major you open 1\S. Partner responds 3\S. What do you say? 

Your 15 points gets revalued to 16/17 for the singleton. Add partner's T-12 and you have enough for game. So you bid 4\S.}

{With 13 points you open 1\S. Partner responds 3\S. What do you say now? 

Figure partner for 11-12 points. You have 13 but could revalue to 14 with the doubleton \H. But the truth is that your points are not very good ones. You should pass.}

Partner's bid forces you to bid again. You have a bare-minimum hand, but at least you have a 6-card suit which you can rebid. You say 2\H and partner raises to 4\H.}
