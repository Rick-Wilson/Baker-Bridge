{Naturally you open 1\H. Partner responds 1\S. What do you say next? 

Partner has at least 4 \Ss and you have 4. So you have found the 8-card Major fit. Now it is a question of finding the right level. Your job is to further describe your hand as either minimum, medium, or maximum. With 17/18 points (revalued) you are a medium, so you jump to 3\S.

Partner bids the game.}

{Of course you open 1\S. Partner responds 2\C. What is your next bid? 

Partner has shown at least 11 points and you are forced to bid again. Since the \Hs rank below \Ss you can bid them with your minimum hand. Apparently that is just what partner wanted to hear since he jumps to 3NT which you happily pass.}

Partner has shown 11+ points and at least 4 \Hs. Your hand revalues to 16 points in support of \Hs, where you know you have an 8-card fit or better. You bid 4\H confidently.}

{We all know you will open 1\S with this hand. And after partner responds 1NT what is your next bid? 

With 6 of them you can rebid \Ss but you are too strong to say just 2\S. Your 17 points puts you in the Medium range where you make a jump. So you bid 3\S and partner bids 4\S.}

{This is a big hand. But not quite enough to open 2\C. So you open 1\H and partner responds 3\H. Now what? 

You might bid 4\D as a slam try, but it is probably just as well to go ahead and ask for Aces. So you bid 4NT and partner owns up to holding 2 Aces. What is your next bid? 

You have all the Aces but don't go crazy. Partner only has 11-12 points so don't think too Grand! Bid 6\H.}
