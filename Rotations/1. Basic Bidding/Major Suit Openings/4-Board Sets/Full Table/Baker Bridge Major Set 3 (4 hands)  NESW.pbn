{You open 1\S and partner responds 2\H. What do you bid next? 

Partner has shown 11+ points and at least 4 \Hs. Your hand revalues to 16 points in support of \Hs, where you know you have an 8-card fit or better. You bid 4\H confidently.}

{We all know you will open 1\S with this hand. And after partner responds 1NT what is your next bid? 

With 6 of them you can rebid \Ss but you are too strong to say just 2\S. Your 17 points puts you in the Medium range where you make a jump. So you bid 3\S and partner bids 4\S.}

[Result ""]
{This is a big hand. But not quite enough to open 2\C. So you open 1\H and partner responds 3\H. Now what? 

You might bid 4\D as a slam try, but it is probably just as well to go ahead and ask for Aces. So you bid 4NT and partner owns up to holding 2 Aces. What is your next bid? 

You have all the Aces but don't go crazy. Partner only has 11-12 points so don't think too Grand! Bid 6\H.}

{With 6 points you must respond and you should let partner know you have support for his suit. So you bid 2\H and he promptly raises to 4\H. It's a good thing he had 20 points isn't it.}
