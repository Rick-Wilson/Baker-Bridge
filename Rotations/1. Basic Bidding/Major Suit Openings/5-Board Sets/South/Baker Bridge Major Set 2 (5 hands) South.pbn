{You open 1\H and partner responds 1\S. It is your bid again. 

You have good \S support but you must tell partner of your minimum hand. So you bid 2\S and he passes.}

[Result ""]
{Naturally you open 1\H. Partner responds 1\S. What do you say next? 

Partner has at least 4 \Ss and you have 4. So you have found the 8-card Major fit. Now it is a question of finding the right level. Your job is to further describe your hand as either minimum, medium, or maximum. With 17/18 points (revalued) you are a medium, so you jump to 3\S.

Partner bids the game.}

{Of course you open 1\S. Partner responds 2\C. What is your next bid? 

Partner has shown at least 11 points and you are forced to bid again. Since the \Hs rank below \Ss you can bid them with your minimum hand. Apparently that is just what partner wanted to hear since he jumps to 3NT which you happily pass.}

[Result ""]
{We all know you will open 1\S with this hand. And after partner responds 1NT what is your next bid? 

With 6 of them you can rebid \Ss but you are too strong to say just 2\S. Your 17 points puts you in the Medium range where you make a jump. So you bid 3\S and partner bids 4\S.}
