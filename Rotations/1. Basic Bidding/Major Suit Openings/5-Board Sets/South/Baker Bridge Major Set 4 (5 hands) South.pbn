{You could bid 1\S. Many would do so, thinking "I have to show partner my \S suit."

In fact, you don't have to show partner your \S suit. You already know of a partnership 9-card fit in \Hs, so there is no reason to search for a possible 8-card fit in \Ss.

With 11 points and 4 trumps you bid 3\H, a limit raise. Partner raises to game.}

{You MIGHT jump to 2NT to "show your points". However, a notrump bid now would deny a 4-card \S suit. Instead, your priority is to show that Major, so you respond 1\S. Partner bids 2\S. What do you say next? 

Partner would not support a response which might be 4 cards unless he had 4 himself. Knowing that you have two opening hands facing each other, each containing 4 \Ss, you bid the \S game.}

{With 4-card support you respond 2\S. Partner raises to 3\S. What do you say next? 

Partner's bid is an invitation. You have told him you have 6-10 points and he probably has about 17-18. If you are at the high end of your 6-T he wants you to bid game, at the low end he wants you to pass. You actually have T, definitely high end, so you bid 4\S.}

{With 7 points and good trumps you respond 2\S. Partner now bids 3\C. What do you bid next? 

Again partner is inviting you to bid game. He wants you to bid it if you are at the top of your 6-T range, and he wants you to particularly promote any Help you can give him in \Cs.

You are at the bottom of your range and you have no help in \Cs, so you just return to \Ss. Partner passes.}

{Your only reasonable response is 2\H. Partner now bids 3\D. What do you say? 

With 8 points you are right in the middle of the 6-10 points you promised. So you could either accept partner's invitation or decline it. BUT, he said you should particularly look at any Help you could provide in \Ds. Since you have lots of good stuff in that suit you upgrade your 8 points and bid 4\H.}
