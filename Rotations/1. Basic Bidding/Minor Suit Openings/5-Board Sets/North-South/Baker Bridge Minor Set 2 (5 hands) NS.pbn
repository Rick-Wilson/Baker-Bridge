{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

With a 5-card and a 4-card Minor you open the 5-card. Partner responds 1NT. What do you say now? 

With only 14 points a pass might be the best bid. But with doubletons in both Majors, knowing partner does not have 4 of either, you elect to bid 2\C. Partner now surprises you and bids 3\C. It's your bid. 

Partner evidently found some hidden treasure when he revalued! But you still have only 16 points at the most so you pass.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

Nice hand! But not strong enough to open with anything other than 1\C. Partner jumps to 3\C! What do you bid? 

You might be tempted to mention one of your Majors at this point, but resist the temptation. Trust that your partner also knows the bidding priorities and that he would have bid a 4-card Major if he had held one. The problem with you now saying 3\H for example, is that partner would probably think you had a 5-card \H suit and support you with only 3 of them. You know that \Cs is your suit so stick to it.

With partner showing 13-16 points, and your hand revaluing to 21 you are definitely thinking slam. It would not be terrible to just bid 6\C right now, but Blackwood was invented just for these situations, to make sure you are not missing 2 Aces when you bid a slam. So you bid 4NT. Partner answers with 5\D. What say you? 

Blackwood did its job. You are missing one Ace so all thoughts of a Grand are put aside. Bid 6\C.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

This would be a perfect hand to open 1NT - well, it would be if it held one more point. But with only 14 you open your 4-card Minor, 1\D. Partner responds 3\D.

What do you say now? 

Partner suggests that \Ds is your suit, and he may be right. But you would much rather play the less demanding Notrump game if he is willing. So you bid 3NT, knowing that if partner is really distributional he will take you back to \Ds. He doesn't, so you play 3NT.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

This would be an ideal hand to open 1NT - well, it would be with one less point. But with 18 you are too strong to open 1NT so you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\S. What do you bid next? 

DO NOT fall into the trap of supporting partner's \Ss just because you have such nice help for him. He might have a 4-card suit. Instead, just describe your hand by jumping to 2NT, showing a balanced hand with 18-19 points. Partner now bids 3NT and you play it there.}

[Result ""]
{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

You open 1\D and partner responds 1\S. What is your next bid? 

Do not support what may be a 4-card suit with only 3 cards. Instead, jump to 2NT, showing 18-19, balanced. Partner rebids the \Ss. What do you say next? 

Partner shows a minimum hand, but with 6 \Ss. 3NT is very tempting, and might work out fine, but with 9 \Ss it is probably better to play the suit game. So you bid 4\S and everybody passes.

Bidding 4\S was a good choice. It makes easily, yet 3NT might have gone down.}
