{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

You have plenty good support to raise partner's \C suit. But your first priority is to show a 4-card Major suit if you have one. You do, so you respond 1\S. Partner raises you to 2\S.  

Are you tempted to take partner back to \Cs since you have such good support? Don't be. Partner has 4 \Ss, but he might have only 3 \Cs.

Are you tempted to bid 3\S since partner raised you? Don't be. He showed a minimum hand with his single raise and you only have 9 points. Just pass.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

Some might jump to 2NT, "to show partner my point count". Some might jump to 3\D, "to force partner to game and show my \D support". The wise ones will just bid 1\H, striving to find an 8-card Major fit, the first priority of bidding.

You choose the 1\H route, and partner obligingly says 2\H. What do you bid next? 

Remember "She who knows, goes"? You know of the 8-card Major fit. You know of at least 26 combined points. You know you should bid 4\H, so you do.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

When you have two 4-card suits to show you bid them "up-the-line". In this case it means you say 1\H. Partner replies 1\S. What do you bid? 

There are enough points for game and a known 8-card Major fit. So you bid 4\S.

Perfect bidding isn't always rewarded. They can win three \D tricks and the Ace of trumps. If the opening lead is a \H or a \C you might make it, so it just depends on luck.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

You have two very good choices, neither of which is really wrong. You could bid 2NT, showing 13-16 points, balanced, or you could bid 3\D, showing 13-16 points, good trump support.

What should decide you is the bidding priorities. You'd much rather try to play a 9-trick game than an 11-trick game. And at the same time you must trust your partner not to leave you hung out in Notrump with an unsuitable hand. (Can you believe I wrote Notrump and unsuitable in the same sentence?)

Anyway, you bid 2NT and partner raises to 3NT.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

With 14 points and a 4-3-3-3 distribution this could be the perfect hand for a jump to 2NT. But not when the 4-card suit is a Major - you should not skip bidding a Major when you have the opportunity.

So you respond 1\H. Partner says 1\S. What do you bid? 

Partner doesn't have 4 \Hs so you go back to thinking this is an ideal notrump hand. So ideal that you apply the "She who knows, goes" principle and bid 3NT. Partner smiles and passes.}
