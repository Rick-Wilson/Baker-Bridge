With 13 points you will open. You cannot bid 1\H with only 4 of them, so you say 1\D. Partner responds 1\H and it is your bid again. 

Partner's response is forcing. He might have anywhere from 6 points to about 17. With a minimum opener and 4-card support for his Major suit you bid 2\H. Partner passes.}

You are not strong enough to open 1NT, but too strong to pass. You bid 1\D. Partner responds 1NT. What do you say next?

With that small doubleton in \Cs it is very tempting to rescue partner from 1NT by bidding 2\S. There are three good reasons why you don't. First, bidding 1\D followed by 2\S is a REVERSE, which shows a strong hand, perhaps 16-17 points or more. Second, and even more important, partner's 1NT bid DENIES a 4-card Major suit. And third, partner probably has something in \Cs since he has no 4-card Major and also didn't feel like supporting your \Ds.

So you pass and hope for the best.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

The \H and \S suits look really good, but neither of them are 5 cards, so you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\H. What is your next bid? 

Partner's bid shows 6-10 points and at least 4 \Hs. Since you now know there is an 8-card Major suit fit you revalue your hand, adding 2 more points for the singleton \D.

That gives you 20 points; add partner's 6-T and you have enough for game. She who knows, goes, so you bid 4\H.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

You have the right strength but the wrong distribution to open 1NT. So you bid 1\C. Partner responds 1\S. What do you say next? 

With partner's \S bid giving you a fit, your hand revalues to 18 points. If partner has only 6 or 7 points there is not enough for game, but if he has more than that then you should bid game.

When you are in-between like this you just invite. So you jump to 3\S. This tells partner to bid game if he has more than the minimum for his bid. He has 9 revalued points, so he bids 4\S.}

This is the one situation when you open a 3-card \D suit; two 4-card Majors, three \Ds and two \Cs, but not enough strength to open 1NT.

Partner responds 2NT. What do you bid? 

Partner's bid shows 13-16 points, balanced. And most importantly, it denies holding a 4-card Major suit. So you do not consider bidding either your \Hs or \Ss, but just bid 3NT.}

With a 5-card and a 4-card Minor you open the 5-card. Partner responds 1NT. What do you say now? 

With only 14 points a pass might be the best bid. But with doubletons in both Majors, knowing partner does not have 4 of either, you elect to bid 2\C. Partner now surprises you and bids 3\C. It's your bid. 

Partner evidently found some hidden treasure when he revalued! But you still have only 16 points at the most so you pass.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

Nice hand! But not strong enough to open with anything other than 1\C. Partner jumps to 3\C! What do you bid? 

You might be tempted to mention one of your Majors at this point, but resist the temptation. Trust that your partner also knows the bidding priorities and that he would have bid a 4-card Major if he had held one. The problem with you now saying 3\H for example, is that partner would probably think you had a 5-card \H suit and support you with only 3 of them. You know that \Cs is your suit so stick to it.

With partner showing 13-16 points, and your hand revaluing to 21 you are definitely thinking slam. It would not be terrible to just bid 6\C right now, but Blackwood was invented just for these situations, to make sure you are not missing 2 Aces when you bid a slam. So you bid 4NT. Partner answers with 5\D. What say you? 

Blackwood did its job. You are missing one Ace so all thoughts of a Grand are put aside. Bid 6\C.}

This would be a perfect hand to open 1NT - well, it would be if it held one more point. But with only 14 you open your 4-card Minor, 1\D. Partner responds 3\D.

What do you say now? 

Partner suggests that \Ds is your suit, and he may be right. But you would much rather play the less demanding Notrump game if he is willing. So you bid 3NT, knowing that if partner is really distributional he will take you back to \Ds. He doesn't, so you play 3NT.}

DO NOT fall into the trap of supporting partner's \Ss just because you have such nice help for him. He might have a 4-card suit. Instead, just describe your hand by jumping to 2NT, showing a balanced hand with 18-19 points. Partner now bids 3NT and you play it there.}

Partner shows a minimum hand, but with 6 \Ss. 3NT is very tempting, and might work out fine, but with 9 \Ss it is probably better to play the suit game. So you bid 4\S and everybody passes.

Bidding 4\S was a good choice. It makes easily, yet 3NT might have gone down.}

Perfect bidding isn't always rewarded. They can win three \D tricks and the Ace of trumps. If the opening lead is a \H or a \C you might make it, so it just depends on luck.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

That is great support, but always remember when supporting a Minor that partner might have only 3 of them. So you bid 2\D. Partner jumps to 4\D. What do you bid? 

You were cautious with your first bid, but that is over now. Partner didn't open with a 3-card suit, he really has \Ds. He bypassed 3NT in a flash, so he has no interest in playing anywhere but a \D contract. He invites you to bid game if you have something extra above the 6 points you already promised. You have a lot more than that, so you bid 5\D.}
