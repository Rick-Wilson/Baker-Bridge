{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

When you have two 4-card suits to show you bid them "up-the-line". In this case it means you say 1\H. Partner replies 1\S. What do you bid? 

There are enough points for game and a known 8-card Major fit. So you bid 4\S.

Perfect bidding isn't always rewarded. They can win three \D tricks and the Ace of trumps. If the opening lead is a \H or a \C you might make it, so it just depends on luck.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

You have two very good choices, neither of which is really wrong. You could bid 2NT, showing 13-16 points, balanced, or you could bid 3\D, showing 13-16 points, good trump support.

What should decide you is the bidding priorities. You'd much rather try to play a 9-trick game than an 11-trick game. And at the same time you must trust your partner not to leave you hung out in Notrump with an unsuitable hand. (Can you believe I wrote Notrump and unsuitable in the same sentence?)

Anyway, you bid 2NT and partner raises to 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

With 14 points and a 4-3-3-3 distribution this could be the perfect hand for a jump to 2NT. But not when the 4-card suit is a Major - you should not skip bidding a Major when you have the opportunity.

So you respond 1\H. Partner says 1\S. What do you bid? 

Partner doesn't have 4 \Hs so you go back to thinking this is an ideal notrump hand. So ideal that you apply the "She who knows, goes" principle and bid 3NT. Partner smiles and passes.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

You have great \D support and perhaps 15 points. The "perhaps" is because partner may have only 3 \Ds, and if you are the long-trump hand any ruffs you take will probably not increase the number of trump tricks your side makes. But still, you have a great hand.

So you bid 3\D. Partner now says 3NT. What do you bid? 

You described your hand very well with your first bid. Partner heard the description and chose 3NT. Since you trust your partner you pass.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

You must make a weak response, and in theory there are 3 weak responses you could make with this hand. You could bid 2\C, 1\S or 1NT. And while none of them would be actually incorrect the best choice is to show your 4-card Major.

You bid 1\S. Partner jumps to 3\S. What do you say now? 

You started with just 6 points, and after discovering the \S fit you revalue all the way up to 7 points. Partner has shown 16-18 and that's still not enough for game. You pass.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

Your top priority as responder is to show a Major suit if you have one, so you say 1\H. Partner jumps to 3\H. What do you say? 

Partner knows you may have only 6 points and went to the 3-level anyway. He is inviting you to bid game if you have a bit more than the 6 you promised. You revalue up to T so you have quite a bit more. You accept his invitation and bid 4\H.}
