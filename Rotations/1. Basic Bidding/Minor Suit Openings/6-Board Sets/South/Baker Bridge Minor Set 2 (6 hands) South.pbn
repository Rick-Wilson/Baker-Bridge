{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

Nice hand! But not strong enough to open with anything other than 1\C. Partner jumps to 3\C! What do you bid? 

You might be tempted to mention one of your Majors at this point, but resist the temptation. Trust that your partner also knows the bidding priorities and that he would have bid a 4-card Major if he had held one. The problem with you now saying 3\H for example, is that partner would probably think you had a 5-card \H suit and support you with only 3 of them. You know that \Cs is your suit so stick to it.

With partner showing 13-16 points, and your hand revaluing to 21 you are definitely thinking slam. It would not be terrible to just bid 6\C right now, but Blackwood was invented just for these situations, to make sure you are not missing 2 Aces when you bid a slam. So you bid 4NT. Partner answers with 5\D. What say you? 

Blackwood did its job. You are missing one Ace so all thoughts of a Grand are put aside. Bid 6\C.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

This would be a perfect hand to open 1NT - well, it would be if it held one more point. But with only 14 you open your 4-card Minor, 1\D. Partner responds 3\D.

What do you say now? 

Partner suggests that \Ds is your suit, and he may be right. But you would much rather play the less demanding Notrump game if he is willing. So you bid 3NT, knowing that if partner is really distributional he will take you back to \Ds. He doesn't, so you play 3NT.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

This would be an ideal hand to open 1NT - well, it would be with one less point. But with 18 you are too strong to open 1NT so you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\S. What do you bid next? 

DO NOT fall into the trap of supporting partner's \Ss just because you have such nice help for him. He might have a 4-card suit. Instead, just describe your hand by jumping to 2NT, showing a balanced hand with 18-19 points. Partner now bids 3NT and you play it there.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

You open 1\D and partner responds 1\S. What is your next bid? 

Do not support what may be a 4-card suit with only 3 cards. Instead, jump to 2NT, showing 18-19, balanced. Partner rebids the \Ss. What do you say next? 

Partner shows a minimum hand, but with 6 \Ss. 3NT is very tempting, and might work out fine, but with 9 \Ss it is probably better to play the suit game. So you bid 4\S and everybody passes.

Bidding 4\S was a good choice. It makes easily, yet 3NT might have gone down.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

You have plenty good support to raise partner's \C suit. But your first priority is to show a 4-card Major suit if you have one. You do, so you respond 1\S. Partner raises you to 2\S.  

Are you tempted to take partner back to \Cs since you have such good support? Don't be. Partner has 4 \Ss, but he might have only 3 \Cs.

Are you tempted to bid 3\S since partner raised you? Don't be. He showed a minimum hand with his single raise and you only have 9 points. Just pass.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

Some might jump to 2NT, "to show partner my point count". Some might jump to 3\D, "to force partner to game and show my \D support". The wise ones will just bid 1\H, striving to find an 8-card Major fit, the first priority of bidding.

You choose the 1\H route, and partner obligingly says 2\H. What do you bid next? 

Remember "She who knows, goes"? You know of the 8-card Major fit. You know of at least 26 combined points. You know you should bid 4\H, so you do.}
