{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would say, then  BID above. 

With 13 points you will open. You cannot bid 1\H with only 4 of them, so you say 1\D. Partner responds 1\H and it is your bid again. 

Partner's response is forcing. He might have anywhere from 6 points to about 17. With a minimum opener and 4-card support for his Major suit you bid 2\H. Partner passes.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

You are not strong enough to open 1NT, but too strong to pass. You bid 1\D. Partner responds 1NT. What do you say next? 

You are not strong enough to open 1NT, but too strong to pass. You bid 1\D. Partner responds 1NT. What do you say next?

With that small doubleton in \Cs it is very tempting to rescue partner from 1NT by bidding 2\S. There are three good reasons why you don't. First, bidding 1\D followed by 2\S is a REVERSE, which shows a strong hand, perhaps 16-17 points or more. Second, and even more important, partner's 1NT bid DENIES a 4-card Major suit. And third, partner probably has something in \Cs since he has no 4-card Major and also didn't feel like supporting your \Ds.

So you pass and hope for the best.}

[Result ""]
{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

The \H and \S suits look really good, but neither of them are 5 cards, so you open 1\C. Partner responds 1\H. What is your next bid? 

Partner's bid shows 6-10 points and at least 4 \Hs. Since you now know there is an 8-card Major suit fit you revalue your hand, adding 2 more points for the singleton \D.

That gives you 20 points; add partner's 6-T and you have enough for game. She who knows, goes, so you bid 4\H.}

1C pass 1S pass 3S pass 4S all pass
[Result ""]
{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

You have the right strength but the wrong distribution to open 1NT. So you bid 1\C. Partner responds 1\S. What do you say next? 

With partner's \S bid giving you a fit, your hand revalues to 18 points. If partner has only 6 or 7 points there is not enough for game, but if he has more than that then you should bid game.

When you are in-between like this you just invite. So you jump to 3\S. This tells partner to bid game if he has more than the minimum for his bid. He has 9 revalued points, so he bids 4\S.}

[Result ""]
{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

This is the one situation when you open a 3-card \D suit; two 4-card Majors, three \Ds and two \Cs, but not enough strength to open 1NT.

Partner responds 2NT. What do you bid? 

Partner's bid shows 13-16 points, balanced. And most importantly, it denies holding a 4-card Major suit. So you do not consider bidding either your \Hs or \Ss, but just bid 3NT.}

{You dealt this hand. What do you bid? 

With a 5-card and a 4-card Minor you open the 5-card. Partner responds 1NT. What do you say now? 

With only 14 points a pass might be the best bid. But with doubletons in both Majors, knowing partner does not have 4 of either, you elect to bid 2\C. Partner now surprises you and bids 3\C. It's your bid. 

Partner evidently found some hidden treasure when he revalued! But you still have only 16 points at the most so you pass.}
