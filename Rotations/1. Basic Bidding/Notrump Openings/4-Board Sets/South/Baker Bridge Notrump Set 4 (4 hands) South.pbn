{You dealt so it is your bid. What do you say? 

With a balanced 20 point hand you open 2NT. Partner responds 3\S. What do you bid next? 

Partner is showing a 5-card \S suit and at least 5 points. This is a forcing bid; you are to choose between 3NT and 4\S, depending on your \S holding. With three of them you bid 4\S.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You have 8 points. Even if partner has the maximum 17 it would only add to 25, which is probably not enough to make game. You should pass.}
