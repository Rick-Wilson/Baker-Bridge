{You dealt so it is your bid. What do you say? 

You open 1NT and partner jumps to 4NT.  

This is the sequel to Deal 4. This time you have 17 points so you accept partner's invitation to slam and bid 6NT.

You have 11 top tricks and can easily set up one more in \Cs.}

[Result ""]
{You dealt so it is your bid. What do you say? 

You open 1NT and partner jumps to 4NT.  

This is the threequel to 4 and 5. With a "good 16" points you accept the invitation and bid 6NT.

As you might expect, this time the slam is not so certain, but there is a good chance. If either Minor suit finesse works you can make 12 tricks.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Surprise - you open 1NT. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid next? (no transfers in this lesson) 

Pass. Partner has long \Hs (probably 6) and short points (fewer than 9). He has decided that 2\H will be a better spot than 1NT. Trust him.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You open 1NT and partner replies 3\H. What do you say next? 

With this bidding method, partner's bid shows at least 10 points and exactly 5 \Hs. He expects you to choose between 3NT and 4\H. Since you have just a doubleton in \Hs you choose 3NT.

NOTE: Jacoby Transfers are very useful for this type of hand.}
