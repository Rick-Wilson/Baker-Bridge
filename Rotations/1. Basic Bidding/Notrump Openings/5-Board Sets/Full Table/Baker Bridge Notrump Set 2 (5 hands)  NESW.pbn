{You dealt so it is your bid. What do you say? 

You open 1NT and partner jumps to 4NT.  

This is the threequel to 4 and 5. With a "good 16" points you accept the invitation and bid 6NT.

As you might expect, this time the slam is not so certain, but there is a good chance. If either Minor suit finesse works you can make 12 tricks.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Surprise - you open 1NT. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid next? (no transfers in this lesson) 

Pass. Partner has long \Hs (probably 6) and short points (fewer than 9). He has decided that 2\H will be a better spot than 1NT. Trust him.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You open 1NT and partner replies 3\H. What do you say next? 

With this bidding method, partner's bid shows at least 10 points and exactly 5 \Hs. He expects you to choose between 3NT and 4\H. Since you have just a doubleton in \Hs you choose 3NT.

NOTE: Jacoby Transfers are very useful for this type of hand.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Yes this is exactly the same hand you held in Deal 8. You still open 1NT. This time partner responds 3\S. What do you bid? 

Partner shows T+ points and exactly 5 \Ss. This time, with 3-card support, you choose game in \Ss, knowing there is an 8-card fit.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You open 1NT and partner says 3\D. It's your bid. 

Partner has a great hand. A jump to 3 in a Minor suit almost always shows slam interest. But that's partner with interest, not you. You couldn't have a more minimum 1NT opening bid. 

So you just return to 3NT. Partner gives up and passes.}
