2NT pass 4NT pass 6NT pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{Because of his 3-4-3-3 distribution, partner chose not to look for a \H fit. If he had opted for Stayman the contract would have turned out the same. The 4NT response is quantitative, inviting you to bid 6NT if you have a maximum.

You do. 6NT.

You will have to make an early decision on whether to hold up or not.

Only one more winner is needed. You should play a low \S from dummy in the hope that East will lead the suit again, giving you a trick with your \SJ (you know East holds \SQ). In fact, you should even give him some incentive to play another \S by dropping your \S9, pretending to hold just the \S J 9. But East noticed his partner's discouraging \S2 and switched to the \C8. 

You try the \CJ but West plays the \CQ and you have to win with your \CK. 

Your chances for success are slipping away and you are down to your last hope. Your \SJ is a threat that only East can guard against. If East also is the defender with long \Hs then he would also have to guard dummy's fourth \H. In that case you could squeeze him. But there is one important play you must make for the squeeze to function. 

You must play dummy's \SA to unblock so your \SJ can be the threat you need. Then play the \HA, \CA and 5 \D winners. 

If East has thrown the \SQ you win your \SJ and dummy's two high \Hs. But since he probably held onto the \SQ you just play a \H to dummy and hope all three \Hs are winners.

 to see if they are. 

You were lucky it wasn't West with the 4 \Hs.}

1NT pass 2H pass 3S pass 4S pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{Partner expects you to bid 2\S.

But your hand has suddenly increased in value - with the known \S fit you add another point for your doubleton and you have 18 points. So you jump to 3\S; this is called a Super-Accept. But so what. Partner just bids the game anyway.

North plays the \HK, then \HA, then \H5.

You need to eliminate two losers. If South has the \DK a finesse will save one loser. If \Cs split 3-2 that will eliminate one loser. And of course your \HJ is ready to provide an immediate discard. 

So what are you going to discard right now on that \HJ? It looks obvious to discard the \DQ; then if the \Cs do split 3-2 (68% chance) you will be home free, losing only two \Hs and one\C. 

Throwing the \DQ is a bad idea. And basically unnecessary. If the \Cs are splitting 3-2 you don't need to keep a fourth \C in both hands. So discard a small \C from dummy and keep the \DQ just in case the \Cs turn out 4-1 and you have to fall back on the \D finesse. 

 to see why. 

After you pull trumps you play the top two \Cs and discover (too late) that you cannot set up a \C winner.

But what if the \DK was actually with North, and the \Cs were splitting 3-2 all the time?

 for an alternate possibility. 

You pull trumps first, then play two top \Cs. When both defenders follow you give up a \C. South wins and plays a \D, but you go up with dummy's \DA, enter your hand with a trump and NOW discard that \DQ on your good \C. }

2H 2NT pass 3NT pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{You should be sure you and partner are on the same page with this bid. A 2NT overcall over a Weak-2 opener shows the same hand as a 1NT overcall over a 1 of a suit opener. In other words, 15-18 points, and at least 1 (preferably 2), stoppers in their suit.

Partner, who is on the same page, bids 3NT.

As expected, West leads his partner's \H suit.

You need 5 more winners. This is important to keep in mind.

You can establish at most 1 winner in \Ds, 2 in \Ss, and 3 in \Cs. Since you must work on both \Ss and \Cs, you don't need to try for anything extra in \Ds. 

If East has both black Aces you will go down, but you know that he cannot have two outside Aces with a 6-card \H suit headed by the Q J and still open with a weak 2-bid. So West must have at least one of the black Aces. 

If you could guess which Ace East holds you could work on that suit first. He would win it, then get his \Hs established, but wouldn't be able to get back in to cash them.

But better than guessing, you should just holdup on the first \H trick and win the next one. Then it won't matter which Ace you knock out first because West will not have a \H to play in either case.

 to see. 

If you win the first trick and then play \Cs, you will be unlucky. West will  take his \CA and play his last \H. Then when East takes the \SA he will set you with \H tricks.

If you hold up on first trick luck won't come into it. It will no longer matter which black suit you establish first.}

1NT 2H 3C pass 3NT pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{After the overcall of your partner's opening 1NT you must make a quick decision with this type of hand:Force to game or settle for partscore. Using lebensohl, a suit bid at the 3-level shows a 5-card or longer suit and is game forcing. You go for it by bidding 3\C (not Stayman) and partner says 3NT.

The contract would be 3NT played by West.

To make East the declarer  ROTATE. 

East plays 3NT. South leads the \HQ. You must make an immediate decision whether to hold up or not.

Of course the \C suit will produce 4 winners so you need just one more in \Ss or \Ds.

First the question of holding up or not. The reason for a hold-up play is to be sure that when North gains the lead he has no \Hs remaining. But in this Deal you can place most of the strength with South so you don't need to hold up. And, in fact, there is a good reason why you shouldn't. 

Win the first trick with your \HK and immediately play a \C, taken by South's \CA. He plays the \HJ which you win with your \HA. North followed suit to the second \H! 

South has 3 \H winners in his hand. There is a good chance that he has the \SK and \DK as well. So if you play either of those suits, leading toward the Queen, South will jump up with his King and put you down 1. So instead, play a \C winner, and when South shows out, play your last \H! South will smile as he takes his three \H winners but then he will frown when he realizes he must lead away from one of his Kings! You, of course, will jump up with dummy's Queen of that suit for your ninth trick.

Always keep in the back of your mind the possibility of an elimination play. In this Deal that meant you needed to refuse the hold-up because you would need the third \H to throw South in with.}
