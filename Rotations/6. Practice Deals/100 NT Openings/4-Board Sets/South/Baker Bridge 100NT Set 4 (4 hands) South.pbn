{Partner's 3\C bid is Stayman; with 4 cards in both Majors you respond 3\H. Partner now bids 3NT.  What do you bid? 

Partner's 3\C bid is Stayman; with 4 cards in both Majors you respond 3\H. Partner now bids 3NT.  What do you bid? 

Partner would not use Stayman unless he held a 4-card Major suit himself. Since he didn't like your \Hs it follows that he must have 4 \Ss.

So you correct the 3NT contract to 4\S. 

If you had left it in 3NT you'd have 8 top tricks and a \S finesse for 9.

But you're in 4\S. 

If you can guess the \SQ your problems are over. But just in case you dislike those 50% guesses, try to find a better Plan. 

Another possibility is that a defender holds either a singleton or doubleton \SQ so you can pick up the suit by leading \S A K. This is smaller than a 50% chance. 

But there is more to the odds than that. Suppose you try the second possibility and play off both the \SA and \SK but the \SQ does NOT drop. You are still not dead! You just leave the \SQ out there and start on \Hs. As long as the defender who holds the \SQ has at least 3 \Hs he will be unable to ruff until after you have discarded dummy's \D loser.

The extra chance makes this Plan your best hope.

 to see which plan works. 

You could have gone down easily by playing West for the \SQ.

Or you could have made it whoever held the \SQ by using the "improved" plan.}

1NT 2H X pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{Sometimes the opponents make overcalls which disrupt the smooth flow of your side's bidding. You and your partner need to have ways of dealing with these disruptions. One possibility is the lebensohl convention which is used a few times in these T0 Deals. There are lots of other methods out there, and you may not care for lebensohl. One of the big reasons we use it is that it includes a penalty double - some other methods use the double for other reasons.

So, in lebensohl an immediate double of their overcall of partner's 1NT opener is for penalties. Just like this one - punish them if they dare try to disrupt your bidding!

To see all the hands  

This is the only Deal like this out of the T0.

No Declarer Plan for you to make, no tricks to look for.

Just play through the deal as you think it might go and see how many tricks you can set South. Enjoy.}

[Result ""]
{Partner's 4NT bid is not Blackwood, it is the Quantitative 4NT. He is unsure whether to bid 6NT or not, so is inviting you to do so.

With 15 points you are supposed to pass. With 17 points you are supposed to bid 6NT. Wouldn't you know it, 16 points. Today you feel bold, so you say 6NT.

East plays the \HA and returns the \H3.

Winner List: \S = 4 : \H = 1 : \D = 2 : \C = 4 :: Total = 11

One trick is already lost and at first glance it looks like your only slim chance will be for the \D Q J to fall doubleton.

But a dummy has a very important card, the \H9. You know from the opening lead that West holds the \HT, so if he happens to hold the only guard in \Ds you will be able to squeeze him in the red suits.  

You don't even have to do anything special. Play your 4 \C winners, then 3 \S winners. 

Now play the \SJ and watch West's discard. If he throws the \HT dummy's \H9 will become a winner. If he doesn't throw the \HT then you know dummy's \H9 is worthless so discard it and hope the \Ds are good.

 to see. 

But not always. Sometimes they just happen, like this one. You were really hoping for the \DQ and \DJ to fall and you fell into the squeeze instead.}

1NT 2S 3H pass 4H pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{When partner opens 1NT, interference can easily gum up your smooth bidding sequences. Playing the lebensohl convention, your 3\H bid shows a 5-card suit and is forcing to game.

It doesn't always work out so well, but here partner had an easy 4\H bid.

Whatever you play, East takes the \S A K J and then plays a small \C. West started with just one \S.

Don't let that Question Mark by the \H losers mislead you - if you are going to make this contract you cannot lose a \H trick at all!Is there any hope? 

The odds aren't good, but you actually have TWO possibilities for success. If West holds the singleton \HK, you can play a small \H to dummy's \HA, dropping the \HK, then finesse East out of his \HJ. Or, if East holds the singleton \HJ you can play your \HQ, finessing West for the \HK and at the same time smothering East's \HJ.

Which basket will you put your eggs into? 

The answer is simple Bridge math!East started with 6 \Ss leaving him 7 cards outside the \S suit. West started with just 1 \S, leaving him with 12 cards outside the \S suit. Obviously East is much more likely to have a singleton \H than West.

So you win the \CA in your hand, play the \HQ and let it ride if West does not cover.

Then you  to see how things turned out. 

But to tell the truth, the Bridge math wasn't really complete. Distribution-wise it was just fine, but there is also the question of strength.

The fact that East overcalled makes it more likely that he holds more high cards than West, and this skews the odds toward East holding the \HK.

But think about it. If East does in fact hold the singleton \HK, and if you cleverly drop it by playing dummy's \HA it won't help you. You will then have to lose a trick to West's \HJ.}
