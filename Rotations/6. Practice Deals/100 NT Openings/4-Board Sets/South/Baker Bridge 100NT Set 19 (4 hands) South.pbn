When the opponents overcall your 1NT opener a 2NT bid by partner is lebensohl. You have been instructed to make a relay bid of 3\C, and you do so. Partner now bids 3\H. What do you say?

The 3\H bid is a sign-off, ala the lebensohl methods. So you pass.

South would be playing the hand in 3\H.

 ROTATE to make North is the Declarer. 

North plays 3\H. East leads the \ST. You win the first trick with dummy's \SA.

Make a Plan then  

The bidding may have been tough but there is absolutely nothing to the play of this hand. You just have to pull trumps so none of your winners get ruffed. So play a \H at trick 2. East wins and plays another \S which you ruff. 

Continue with two more rounds of trumps. Then play to a \C honor. Unless the \Cs split 3-3 you will lose two tricks in the suit but your fourth \C can be ruffed with dummy's last trump. Of course you also have the \D loser which you couldn't avoid.

The purpose of the hand is to point out the advantages of using lebensohl convention when the opponents interfere. It got you to a makeable 3\H contract.

And just look at the EW hands. They can easily make 3\S.}

Partner bids Stayman; with no 4-card Major you respond 2\D. Partner now bids 3\S.  What do you bid? 

Partner's bidding is crystal clear. He has described a hand with at least 11 points, which has 4 \Hs and 5 \Ss.

The decision is yours, and with no 8-card Major suit fit you decide on 3NT.

On West's \HJ opening lead East plays the \HQ.

Winner List: \S = 0 : \H = 2 : \D = 3 : \C = 2 :: Total = 7

You must establish some \S tricks which means you will be finessing through West. Since West can get the lead at most once in \Ss you should not hold up in \Hs. The problem with a hold up is that East may pocket one \H trick and then switch to \Cs, a suit in which you are no better off. 

Win the \HK and play your \S9, letting it ride. Suppose it holds the trick. Continue with another \S, taken by East's \SQ. 

East cannot hurt you. If he has a \H to play, then \Hs will have broken no worse than 4-2 and you will lose two \Hs and two \Ss.

If East plays any other suit you have a double stopper and can establish \S tricks before they can set up a winner of their own.

 to see what might have happened if you held up. 

East could play a \C, knocking out one of your \C A K. When East won his first \S he would establish the \Cs, and when he took the second \S he could cash 2 \C tricks. }

Partner's 2NT is lebensohl, requesting that you bid 3\C. You obey and partner now bids 3\H. What do you say?

The cue-bid is Stayman, asking if you have 4 \Ss. However, since it was a DELAYED cue-bid it also shows stopper(s) in the opponent's overcalled suit. Since you do not have 4 \Ss you go ahead and bid 3NT.

West naturally attacks in his suit, leading the \HQ.

There are several possibilities for extra winners. The \DQ might drop - or the finesse might work, providing one winner. The \Cs might split 3-2, giving you one extra winner. The \S honors might be split (or West might hold both) so the double finesse would give you two winners. Since your minor suit hopes require that BOTH of them work, your best bet is the double \S finesse. 

You do not need to hold up on the \H because you will be finessing twice into East, and he cannot possibly have more than two \Hs, probably only one. Come to your hand with a \C, play the \SJ and let it ride. East wins the \SQ and plays another \C. Win this one and finesse the \S again. When this finesse works you can return to your hand with a \D and repeat the finesse.

Even if East held both honors you would STILL have established one \S winner and would have the possibility of a \D finesse. }

{Partner's 1NT overcall shows 15-18 points and guarantees a \S stop. With 11 points and no 4-card \H suit you say 3NT.

The contract would be 3NT played by South.

To make North the declarer  ROTATE. 

North plays 3NT. East leads the \SK. Do you hold up or not?

You need just one more winner. It could come from a finesse of the \CJ. It could come from a 3-3 \H split. It could come by establishing a fourth card in \Ds.

Most important for now is the \S lead? Do you hold up? 

Yes you should hold up. In fact you might as well hold up twice since you aren't contemplating a throw-in of East. Holding up twice will protect you in the unlikely event that East made his 2\S bid with a 5-card suit. 

Both the \H possibility and the \C possibility will either work or not, so you can save them for later. Your highest percentage chance is the fourth \D, but here you must be careful. You must try to establish the \Ds without allowing East to get the lead. It is actually pretty easy. Just play a small \D from your hand and when East plays low insert the \DT. West wins the \DJ but cannot harm you with his return.

When the remaining \Ds fall you have established your ninth trick.

If he does that he hands you all four \D tricks!}
