{With 17 points and a 6-card suit you are definitely thinking about slam. The way to suggest slam to partner is to jump in a suit, so you bid 3\D.

Typically you start showing controls, up the line. So you bid 4\H, showing the \HA. Partner then bids 4\S. What do you bid next?

Partner says 4\D, bypassing 3NT and agreeing to your suit; what do you bid?

Typically you start showing controls, up the line. So you bid 4\H, showing the \HA. Partner then bids 4\S. What do you bid next?

When partner shows first round \S control you know you don't have two quick losers, so you bid 6\D.

You win East's opening lead with dummy's \SA.

You only have one too many losers, and you have a very obvious finesse for the \HK. But first you pull trumps in two rounds. Do you take the \H finesse now?  

No you don't. In fact you won't need to take it at all, not with that very valuable \SJ in dummy. 

Play a \C to dummy's \CQ, then ruff the \S7 in your hand. Next play \CK, then another \C to dummy's \CA. Play the \SJ from dummy and discard your \H5. East will win this trick, (from the opening lead you knew he had the \SQ), but he will be end-played. A \S or a \C will give you a ruff/sluff, but a \H will give you a free finesse into your \H A Q. 

Sometimes being about 50% of the time on average.

So whenever you see your contract depending on a finesse, just look again and see if perhaps an elimination play is available.}

2H 2NT pass 3NT pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{Over an opponent's Weak 2-bid a 2NT overcall is used to show basically the same as a 1NT opening bid, but promising stopper(s) in their suit.

Partner bids 3NT.

As expected, South leads his partner's \H suit.

You need only one more winner; the best chance will be a 3-2 split in \Cs. But if that doesn't happen you might have to try the finesse in either \Ss or \Ds. The problem is that both finesses go into the North hand. Because of that fact there is no reason to hold up on the first trick so you win the \HA. Then you play the \CA . . . and North discards a \D! 

Don't be sad that the \Cs didn't split, your contract is now guaranteed!Well, guaranteed as long as North has only a 6-card \H suit.

Play your \HK, and when South follows suit play your \H7. North wins this trick and he can also win 3 more \H tricks. But when he runs out of \Hs he will be forced to play a \S or a \D because he doesn't have any \Cs. Either one will give you your ninth trick.

But it wouldn't matter, you would still play the same way. As long as you can strip North of any \Cs you can make the throw-in.}

Your dream just came true. So pass and it won't turn into a nightmare.

The contract would be 2\S played by South.

To make North the declarer  ROTATE. 

North plays 2\S. East leads the \CK.

That is a lot of losers. But it makes the plan that much easier. You will try to make as many of dummy's small trumps as you can, and you will do that by ruffing \Cs.  

Win the \CA and ruff a \C in dummy. Return to your hand with the \DA and ruff another \C. Back to your hand with the \HA and ruff another \C.

You have taken 6 tricks already and cannot be prevented from winning two more trumps.

Lucky for you the defenders didn't see the advantage of playing three rounds of trumps right off the bat.

It would be tough for East to come up with a \S lead from \S K 7 3, but it would have been great defense.}

1NT pass 3NT pass pass pass
[Result ""]
{Holding a 4-card \H suit some bidders would use Stayman. However, when you have 4-3-3-3 distribution there is little chance of ruffing so others prefer not to use Stayman. You take the latter view and bid 3NT with your 11 points.

The contract would be 3NT played by West.

To make East the declarer  ROTATE. 

East plays 3NT. South leads the \CK and North follows with the \C5.

Do you hold up? If so, how many times?

Your ninth trick will be either the \SJ or the \DQ. In both cases the finesse would be into the South hand so the question of disrupting opponent's communications doesn't arise - North is not going to get the lead.

Nonetheless it is a good idea to hold up - but only once. 

South then plays the \CQ which you win as North follows. Next you run four \H tricks, ending in dummy. You play dummy's \SK, your sixth trick so far. It is crunch time. Do you now finesse for the \DK or the \SQ? 

The answer is NO, you do not take either finesse. Instead you play a \C, hoping South must take the trick. And he does. South then cashes two more \C tricks but then he is out of \Cs. Since he is also out of \Hs he is going to have to play either a \S or a \D, either one of which will make you very happy!

If North had not followed to the second \C you might not have been able to use the endplay. Instead you would have run the \Hs, and if South did not discard a \C, you would have to guess as to which finesse to try. With the cards as shown neither would have worked.}

{Partner transfers and you naturally respond 2\S. Partner bids the \S game and you pass. 

West plays the \C8 and your first decision is whether to hold up.

You should certainly hold up. West is the Danger hand here because if West ever gets the lead he can play a \H through your unprotected \HK, possibly giving you two \H losers. If you take the first trick with the \CA you open the door for West to gain entry with the \CK which you know he has. 

Next pull three rounds of trumps. Fortune smiles and they split 3-2. 

Now it's time to play on \Ds. Do you finesse for the \DQ? and if so, which way do you finesse? 

Missing 6 \Ds to the Queen of course you should finesse. And you will finesse through West, of course, because he is the Danger Hand. So play dummy's \DK, then play the \DT and let it ride.

 to see how your Plan turned out. 

Another time East will hold the \DQ and you will make the contract, but no overtrick. }
