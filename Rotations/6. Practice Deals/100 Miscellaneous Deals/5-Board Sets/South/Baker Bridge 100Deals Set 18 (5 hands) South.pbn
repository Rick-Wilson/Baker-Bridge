{You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You open 1\H, West overcalls 1\S and partner passes.

What do you say? 

You shouldn't let West steal from you so you will bid your \Hs again. You must decide between 2\H and 3\H. Given that partner might have had a pretty decent hand yet still have to pass, you decide to go with 3\H. Partner bids 4\H. 

South plays 4\H. West leads the \SQ.

Losers: \S 2 : \H 1 : \D 2 : \C 0 : Total = 5

Win the \SK, then enter dummy with the \CA and play another \S toward your \SA. You do this to prevent East ruffing your high \S. Next you lead the \S2 and ruff with dummy's \HK. Ruff a \C to get back to your hand and ruff the \S7 with dummy's \H9. East may over-ruff this, but only with a trump trick he was going to win anyway.

You will lose two \Ds and the \HQ but no more.

The problem is that East would have over-ruffed the \H9 and then played another \H and you would not have gotten to ruff either \S,}

{You are North and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You respond 1\S, your 5-card Major. Partner jumps to 3\H.

Make your next bid. 

Partner is showing 16-18 points and you have 9. Since he rebid \Hs he must have at least six of them you you know there is an 8-card fit. You bid 4\H.

South would play 4\H.

North plays 4\H. East leads the \CK.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 0 : \D 2 : \C 2 : Total = 4

You might consider setting up dummy's \S suit for a discard but there are too few entries to make that work.

More promising is playing West to have at least one of the \D honors and taking two finesses in that suit. BUT, entries are still a problem. You can only reach dummy twice, once with the \CA and once with the \HQ, and you must play \Ds each time you are there.

Win the first trick with the \CA and play the \DJ, letting it ride if West doesn't cover. East will win this trick and take two \Cs. He will probably then lead a \S. You win your \SA, play \HA then a small \H to dummy's \HQ. Now lead a \D and finesse with your \D9. When this wins, pull trumps and claim.

This will happen about 75% of the time, so the double finesse is a good Plan. And on this Deal it was the only plan available.}

{You are North and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You respond with your 5-card Major, 1\S.

Partner jumps to 3\H. What do you bid? 

With partner's 16-18 points you probably have enough strength for game.

With partner's six \Hs you have an 8-card fit.

So you bid 4\H.

South would play 4\H.

North plays 4\H. East leads \CA, \CK, \C4. West plays \C8 then \C2.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 0 : \D 1 : \C 3 : Total = 4

Suppose you discard a \D from dummy. If West doesn't ruff this \Cthen your \CQ will win. You could then try to establish dummy's \DQ to discard your fourth \C on. 

But you know that plan won't work because West IS going to ruff this \C if you discard. You only have one chance to make this contract, and that is the chance that West was not dealt the \HJ. So you ruff with dummy's \HT and pray West doesn't over-ruff.

So you won that trick and still had your \CQ to use after you pulled trumps.}

{You are North and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

Responding to preempts is easy. You don't count points, you just count tricks. Assume partner for 6 tricks and add yours to see how high to go (or not go).

Here, with three Aces and a possible \S ruff you raise to game.

South would play 4\H.

North plays 4\H. West leads the \DK.

Win the \DA, play \CA and ruff the \C2 with a high trump. Play a \H to the \HT and ruff the \C4 with a high trump. Play a \H to the \HJ and ruff the \C8 with a high trump. Play a \H to the \HA and discard a loser on the good \C9.

Fortunately that occurs a high percentage of the time. In any case, there was no other hope.}

[Result ""]
{You are North and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You have 16 points - a pretty solid 16 in fact. Partner has 15, 16 or 17, so together you have 31, 32 or 33. You want to invite partner to bid 6NT if he has 17, but to decline if he has 15. The correct bid for this invitation is 4NT. It is called a "quantitative" 4NT since it is just an invitational raise. It is NOT Blackwood - if you wanted to ask for Aces you would use Gerber.

Partner bids the slam.

South would play 6NT.

North plays 6NT. East leads the \S3.

Winner count: \S 0 : \H 3 : \D 4 : \C 4 : Total = 11

It's pretty clear which suit you have to worry about! Your goal is simple, you must win one \S trick before you lose two. So the crux of your problem is: Who holds the \SA and \SQ?

If East has both of them you are guaranteed to win the first trick no matter what you play.

If West has both of them you are going to lose the first two tricks no matter what you play.

The problem is to decide what to do if they are split. The answer relies on psychology, not on probability. East has made an attacking lead. But if you were East would you start out leading a low \S from a suit like \S A 9 7 3? That would be incredibly foolhardy, you would probably lead a different suit and save your \SA for catching something high from declarer. On the other hand you would be quite likely to lead a small card from \S Q 9 7 3. 

Your PLAN should be to play low in dummy and win your \ST if West withholds the \SA.

Since East is unlikely to underlead an Ace against 6NT you play West for the \SA. }
