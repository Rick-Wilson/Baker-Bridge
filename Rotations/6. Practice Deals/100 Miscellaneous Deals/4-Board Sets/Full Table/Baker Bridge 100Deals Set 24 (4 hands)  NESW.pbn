{You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

Two choices come to mind - 2NT or 2\H.

Of the two, 2\H is better because it prevents a possible 4-4 \H fit from being lost. Partner rebids his \Ss.

Two opening hands equal one game. Since partner has 6 \S that game might as well be 4\S. 

North would play 4\S.

South plays 4\S. West leads the \CJ. They play two more high \Cs.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 2 : \D 0 : \C 2 : Total = 4

You ruff the third \C, then play \SQ and \SJ. Come to your hand with the \DA and pull the last trump. Now decide what to do with the \Hs.

If West has both \HK and \HQ then a simple finesse of the \HJ will bring in the contract. This is only a 25% chance.

If the high \H honors are split, but West holds the \HT then a finesse of the \H9 will force East to win with his high honor. You can return to your hand and then finesse West out of his other \H honor. This play has about a 50% chance of working so it is the one you should make.

The only time it is a mistake is when West holds the \H K Q and East holds the \HT. Even in that case though some Wests will "split their honors" and give it away.}

{You are East and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You have a valid opening 1NT bid. You also have a valid opening 1\H bid. It is up to you and your partner to agree on whether you will open 1NT when you hold a 5-card Major.

For the purpose of this Deal, and not choosing sides, you open 1\H. Partner responds 2\H. 

You agree on Where, now you must figure out How High. Add partner's 6-T to your 17 and you get 23-27. In other words you might have enough for game if partner has a maximum. 

You want to make an invitational bid and it is ok to now bid 3\H. Partner will understand what you mean and will either pass or bid 4\H, depending on his hand.

But you can also bid any other suit and it will have the same invitational quality to it, but it will give partner the information about where you could use some help. This is called a Help Suit Game Try. In this case you bid 3\C.

Partner, with 9 points and help for \Cs, bids 4\H.

East plays 4\H. South leads the \CJ.

Losers: \S 2 : \H 1 : \D 1 : \C 0 : Total = 4

The \SA and the \HA definitely won't go away. And the \D loser is pretty sure also. However, the second \S loser can be eliminated either by leading up to the \S K Q 5 or by ruffing it in dummy.

Suppose you win the \C and play one round of trumps. Oops, it is now too late to make the contract. Someone can win the \HA and play another \H. Then, whoever takes the \SA can lead a third \H and you can no longer ruff your \S.

Try this instead. Win the \C in dummy and play a small \S to your \SQ. Assume South wins the \SA and leads \HA and another \H. You win this in your hand, play \SK and ruff your last \S with dummy's last trump. Now get to your hand, pull trumps and give up a \D at the end.

Suppose when you led toward your \SQ it held the trick. Would you be convinced that North musthold the \SA and change your plan? Would you then pull trumps and let your contract depend on that assumption? I hope not.}

{You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

With 14 points and only one biddable suit this was a snap. You open 1\C. Partner responds with 1\S. What do you bid? 

This one isn't such a snap. You sure cannot support \Ss with only 2 of them, even good ones. You aren't supposed to rebid your \Cs without a 6-card suit. You hate to bid Notrump with neither of the two red suits stopped, and you cannot pass. So you bite the bullet and say 1NT. Partner jumps it to 3NT and you pass, hoping he can stop the red suits.

South plays 3NT. It turns out partner can't stop \Hs either and the defenders reel off 4 \H tricks, then lead a small \D.

Winners: \S 2 : \H 0 : \D 2 : \C 3 : Total = 7

You need 2 more tricks and you expect to get them from \Cs. This should have been evident while they were leading all those \H winners so you would not have discarded one of the \Cs from your hand. But you also had to be careful not to discard even one of dummy's \Cs, you need all three of them.

If the \Cs split 3-2 it wouldn't matter, but if East happens to have \C J x x x then you will need dummy's third \C to make a finesse. You first play your \CA, then lead a small \C to dummy's \CK. West shows out on this \C so you know that East has \C J 9 left. You lead dummy's \C7, finessing East out of the \CJ. 

This was a very difficult hand.}

[Result ""]
{You are West and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You have 23 points. You must open 2\C.

Partner responds 2\D showing 7 or fewer points.

What do you bid? 

Following partner's negative response you merely bid your suit at the cheapest level.

You bid 2\S and partner jumps to 4\S.

Now what do you say? 

Partner's first response told you he has a weak hand. It didn't suddenly turn into T or 11 points. Partner is merely pulling a "He Who Knows, Goes" bid. He thinks you belong in 4\S.

West plays 4\S. North leads the \DQ.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 3 : \D 0 : \C 1 : Total = 4

It is possible (but not probable) that \Cs will split 3-3. 

It is possible (one chance out of two) that South holds the \HA. You could pull trumps, ending in dummy, then lead toward your \HK.

It is almost certain that you could ruff your \H loser in dummy, but only if you play a \H at trick two, leading away from your \HK. The defenders will win the \H cheaply and probably play a trump. You win dummy's \SA and play another \H which they also win. They lead a second trump which you win in your hand. You now ruff the last \H with dummy's \SJ, return to your hand, pull trumps and claim.

If instead you decide to lead a \S to dummy's \SJ and lead a \H toward your \HK you might go down. North could win the \HA and play a second trump. When you played the next \H North would win again and play a third round of trumps. You would no longer be able to ruff the \H loser.}
