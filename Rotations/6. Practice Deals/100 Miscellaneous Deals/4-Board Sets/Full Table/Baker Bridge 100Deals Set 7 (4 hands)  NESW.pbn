{You are North and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

Of course you open 1\S. Partner responds 2\C.  

With 17 points and a 6-card suit you jump to 3\S. Partner bids the game.

North plays 4\S. East leads the \HQ.

Losers: \S 1 : \H 1 : \D 2 : \C 0 : Total = 4

You have plenty of \C winners in dummy but you must be careful because there are no outside entries. You win your \HA and play \SA and \SK, both defenders following suit. The \SQ is still out. To make sure you get to enjoy those \C winners you should continue with another \S, forcing out the \SQ. The defense will now take a \H if they are smart, but the rest of the tricks are yours because you can run the \C suit without anyone trumping in.

West would have used his master \SQ to ruff the second \C, before you had taken any discards. You would still have to lose a \H and two \Ds.}

{You are West and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

East's 1NT opening shows a maximum of 17 points. Add your 7 and you come up with only 24 - not enough to think about game. So you pass.

East would play 1NT.

West plays 1NT. North leads the \C4. South plays the \CQ, then the \CK , North playing the \C3 on the second trick. South then plays the \C2 which you win with your \CA.

Winners: \S 2 : \H 0 : \D 3 : \C 1 : Total = 6

You only need one more winner and there are possibilities in \Ss, \Hs and \Ds. But you need to be very careful. If you watched those \C spots you will realize that North started with 5 \Cs (he led the \C4, later played the \C3). So the defenders will win 2 more \C tricks to go with the 2 they already have. And they can also take the \HA and \HK whenever they want. In other words, they also have 6 winners. So the battle is for the 7th trick for either side. If you do anything that gives them a trick they will win.

So you don't try for a trick in \Ss or \Ds. Instead you play on \Hs, the suit where they have the 2 sure winners anyway. They will win one of their high honors, take their 2 \Cs, then play either \Ss or \Ds. You win and drive out the other \H honor.

If you play your three high \Ds you will set up a winner for THEM and you will go down.

Only if you establish your \Hs can you set up a winner for YOU without giving them an extra trick. }

{You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You have an easy choice, you open 1\S.

Partner responds 1NT.  

Partner is showing 6-10 points. With 17 points you are strong enough to invite game. You show your 6-card suit by jumping to 3\S. Partner bids 4\S.

South plays 4\S. West leads the \CQ.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 2 : \D 1 : \C 1 : Total = 4

You have no time to waste. You have no way to discard either minor suit loser, so you absolutely must ruff a \H in dummy. You dare not pull a trump. Win the \CA in dummy and play a \H to your \HQ. West will win and probably lead a trump. You win, cash the \HK and ruff your small \H with dummy's last trump. Now take the \DA and give up the lead. Ruff at the first opportunity and pull trumps, making 6 \S tricks, 2 minor suit Aces, one \H trick and a \H ruff in dummy.

Always draw them - unless you have some other need for them first. Like in this hand.

Notice this. You cannot fault West for his opening lead, top of an honor sequence is very logical. BUT, if he had led a trump you would have gone down.}

{You are West and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You open 1\S. Partner responds 2\S. What is your bid? 

This was easy. You had a minimum opening bid and partner gave a minimum response. You pass.

West plays 2\S. North leads the \HQ.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 1 : \D 3 : \C 2 : Total = 6

You have one loser too many. It doesn't seem you can do anything about the 3 \Ds but you might be able to avoid one of the \Cs if you are lucky. However, you can probably get rid of the \H loser by ruffing it in dummy. 

One small worry - South's play of the \H9 might be the start of a doubleton signal. If so, he may be able to over-ruff dummy. You should have played the \HA on the first trick. Next you pull two rounds of trumps with \SA, \SK. Only then do you play \HK and \H8 ruffing with dummy's last trump. Fortunately South only had two trumps and cannot over-ruff, even though he is out of \Hs.

When you get back in you will pull trumps and lead toward dummy's \C K J, hoping to make a good guess.

The only way to make the contract was to ruff a \H in dummy. }
