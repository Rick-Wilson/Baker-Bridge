{You are East. The bidding has been as shown.

Partner led the \SJ, won by dummy's \SQ. The \D5 is now played from dummy. What do you play?

When you have made your choice  

Considering that South opened 1NT, he must have the \DQ for this play to make sense. 

So if you put on your \DA, South will have TWO \D winners established. If instead you play low, then South cannot get a second \D trick and will have to look elsewhere for his ninth trick. As you can see, he is not going to be able to find it.}

Your lead of the \CJ was won by South with the \CA. South then played the \H2 and you must decide whether to split your honors.

South's bidding showed at least 5 \Hs, so assuming he holds both the \H A Q, it would be silly for him to finesse the \H9 on the first trump play.

As it turns out, when you play low South calls for dummy's \HK, East's \HQ falls and you now have 2 trump tricks. If you had played the \HT you would have tossed away the setting trick.}

Declarer then calls for the \HJ. Do you cover with your \HQ or not?

When you have made your choice  

North has 5 \Hs and South must have at least 5. The reason you cover an Honor is that you hope to establish a lower card in either your hand or partner's hand. But your partner has one \H at the most so there is no hope of establishment.

Now that you have looked at the hands aren't you glad you didn't cover?}

South then plays the \S4 from his hand. Do you play low? or play the \SJ to force dummy's \SA?

When you have made your choice  

If South decides to finesse the \ST then you will still win the one \S trick which you are entitled to win. 

However, with South holding the \SQ it would be very logical for him to go up with the \SA then lead back toward his \SQ, playing East for the \SK. If he plays this way you will get two tricks and defeat the contract.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown.

Partner led the \H9, taken by dummy's \HT. The \S4 is then played from dummy. Do you play low? or split your honors?

When you have made your choice  

You should always make a point count check as soon as you see dummy. South's 2NT promises 20 or 21 points, North has 14 and you have 3; total = 37 or 38. Therefore West must have either 2 or 3 points. He cannot have two Jacks because you can see all four of them. Likewise he cannot have a Queen because you can see three of them and his \H lead (top of nothing) denied that Queen.

It follows that West MUST have a King, and it must be \Cs or \Ds since he has denied any \H Honor.

Since West will definitely win his King, you need to take one trick yourself, and the best way to do that is to split your Honors to establish one \S winner.

South has no defense to this, but if you had played low he would have played the \ST and made the slam. }

You lead the \ST; low cards from North and East, won by South with the \SA.

South next plays the \C3 and you must decide whether to split your \C K Q.

When you have made your choice  

If you split your Honors, playing the \CQ perhaps, dummy's \CA will take the trick and South will later play through your \CK toward dummy's \C J 9 5. Played in this way he will establish 3 \C winners (which he needs for the contract).

If you play low, he MIGHT finesse the \CJ and again establish 3 \C winners. But South's correct play would be to put on dummy's \C9, finessing West for the \CT. This is because \C K T or \C Q T are twice as likely as \C K Q.

If he does play this way East will win the \CT and your \C K Q will get one more trick.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown, (wild).

Partner led the \DJ; \DQ from dummy, \DK from you and ruffed by South.

South then pulls two rounds of trumps, (West discards on the second one), followed by his \SQ, dummy's \S A K and dummy's \DA. South discards \Cs on the last two cards.

The \C6 is then played from dummy and you must make a decision - \CA or \C2?

When you have made your choice  

You have a full count on South's hand. He started with 2 \Ss, 7 \Hs, and no \Ds. His other 4 cards must have been \Cs, and he has discarded 2 of them.

So he has 2 \Cs left in his hand. If one of them is the \CK and you play your \CA then you have handed him the contract.

By playing low you give him a guess to make. If he plays the \CK he will make the contract, but if he plays the \CJ he will go down. He will probably play the \CJ, figuring you woudn't have the nerve to duck with the \CA. He'll know better next time he plays against you.}

When you have made your choice  

First ask yourself "Where are the \DA and \DQ?"East doesn't have either one or he would have played it at the first trick. So South has both of them. So with those 3 tricks and the 5 \Hs in dummy South only needs to find one more winner. Assuming he has the \CK, (or why play the suit), if you play low he will find that one more winner whichever high \C he plays.

Next ask yourself "Where is the \SA?"Clearly East DOES have this card; otherwise South has his 9 tricks.

So the way to beat the contract is to go up with your \CA, then play \SK, \SQ and a third \S, hoping East holds \S A x x x.}

South enters dummy with the \SK and leads the \DT. What do you play?

When you have made your choice  

You don't have much in your hand, but you do have the \DA, and you also have the responsibility to help West set up his suit.

So even though you don't know for sure how good that suit is, your plan of action should be to take the \DA and return a \H.

As you see, this will defeat the contract. Had you played a low \D South would have pocketed that trick and added 4 \Cs and 3 \Ss to go with the \H he had already won.}

When you have made your choice  

You should not allow yourself to be misled by South winning the first trick with the \SQ. East does not hold either the \SA or the \SJ or he would have played it. South is just trying to be deceptive.

That means you need the next \S play to come from East, so you play your \CJ and let East win his \CA. You can be sure East has the \CA because South would have played the suit differently if he held the Ace.

East will win the \CA and return his \S through South's \S A Q. This allows you to set up your \S suit while you still have the \CK for an entry.}

When you have made your choice  

Even though South holds the \SA, if you ruff now he will just put on a small \S and you will be ruffing a loser. Instead discard a \D.

South will win the \SA, but will not be able to ruff any \S losers in dummy because your trumps can overruff any of North's trumps.

Suppose you had ruffed the \S. South would have played his \S9, leaving himself with \S A J. He would then get the lead and pull your two remaining trumps. That would leave one trump in dummy to ruff his \SJ, his only remaining loser.}

West's second \S play was the 2, so it looks like he started with 5 \Ss. And the fall of South's \Ss looks like he may have 1 \S left, very likely the \SK.

All this means that you should take your \DA now and return your last \S to establish West's suit. Now West's \DK will be an entry to the \Ss

If you play low, West will have to take the \DK now, and although he can play a \S to establish the suit, he will not have an entry to be able to cash them.}

If East has a \C trick it is important to get it established soon. So go up with the \SA and play a \C through dummy's \C A Q. When South tries the \S suit again EAST can win and cash his \CK for the setting trick.

[Result ""]
{You are West. The bidding has been as shown.

You lead the \DJ and dummy's \DA wins the first trick. Declarer pulls trumps with dummy's \SK, then his \SA. He then plays his \DK and follows with \CQ, \CK and \CA, discarding a \H from his hand on the last.

With all that completed South plays the \HA. What do you play?

When you have made your choice  

It may look foolish to waste your \HK but look what will happen if you don't. South will follow up with another \H and when you win the \HK you will be forced to play a minor suit. Since both North and South are out of \Ds and \Cs you will be giving them a ruff-sluff and the contract.

But if you dump your \HK under South's \HA look at what's left. South has \H losers and when he plays a \H from either hand East will scoop up two tricks with his \H Q T.}
