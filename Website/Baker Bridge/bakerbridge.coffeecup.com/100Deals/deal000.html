<br>

<b>ABOUT 100 DEALS</b>
<br><br>
Each Deal shows only your hand during the Bidding pages. You are asked to decide what bid/call you would make for 
the hand and when you have decided you click <b><font style="color:#000099">BID</font></b> to go to the next page where the recommended bid is shown with 
any appropriate comments. This continues throughout the Bidding section, and when the final bid is made your 
partner's hand is also shown.
<br><br>
With both hands visible and the opening lead noted you are asked to make a Plan for each Deal. You should think 
this through just as if you were at the table. When you have the Plan in your mind, click <b><font style="color:#000099">NEXT</font></b>.
<br><br>
Don't short-change yourself, it is very easy to just click and see 
the "answer", but you will get more out of it by making your own Plan and then comparing.
<br><br>
All Notrump Plans include a Winner Count and all Suit Plans include a Loser Count.
<br><br>
During the Bidding section you are in the South position. As a result of that some of the Deals would end up with 
your partner North as the Declarer. When that happens you click <b><font style="color:#000099">ROTATE</font></b> 
to orient the hand so South becomes the Declarer.
<br><br>
In  the last section the full deal, East/West hands included, is shown.
<br><br>
You may use the left Navigation panel to go to any numbered Deal you like, or you may just go to the Next Deal 
by clicking the link at the bottom of the final section of a Deal.
<br><br>
If you experience a problem with the formatting of the Deals it may be due to the Text Size you are using 
in your browser. Go to the View menu and adjust Text Size.
<br><br><br>
