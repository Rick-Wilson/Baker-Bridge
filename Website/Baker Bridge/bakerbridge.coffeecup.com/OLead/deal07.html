		You held this identical hand in Deal 3.<br>
		The declarer was playing 3NT and the best lead was the &spades;4, fourth down.
		<br><br>
		It's different when the conract is 6NT. Against 6NT you should make a passive lead, which 
		means don't underlead any honors. Against 6NT you have little chance of establishing a suit to 
		win four or five tricks. Instead, you just want to try to not give declarer an undeserved trick.
		<br><br>
		So any passive lead would be OK, you pick the <span class="red">&hearts;</span> just because they 
		are less likely to have an unbid 4-card Major in either hand.
		<br><br>
		Declarer has 11 winners sitting there; if you had led a low &spades; you would have handed him 
		his 12 trick on a platter.
