		Lead the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>9, the top of nothing.
		<br><br>
		Your &clubs;s are so good that all your instincts tell you to lead 
		the &clubs;8, and perhaps set up 3 winners.
		<br><br>
		If you had one more small &clubs;s your instincts would be right, but with 
		only a 4-card suit you should think a little longer.<br>
		Three tricks won't set this contract, so you must depend on partner winning something. 
		And if partner is going to win something perhaps he will lead a &clubs; 
		and you might make FOUR tricks in the suit.
		<br><br>
		So lead the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>9. You lead a high card so partner won't be tempted 
		to return the suit when he gets the lead. Note that although this lead finesses partner's 
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q, it didn't do anything that declarer wouldn't have done on 
		his own.
		<br><br>
		Declarer must play <span class="red">&diams;</span>s to get some winners, and when East takes 
		the <span class="red">&diams;</span>A he will surely switch to the &clubs;J. Down goes declarer.
