		Play the <span class="red">&diams;</span>3 and when South plays another <span class="red">&diams;</span> win with your <span class="red">&diams;</span>A.
		<br><br>
		North hoped his <span class="red">&diams;</span> suit would provide enough tricks to make the game.<br>
		You can see that there is no entry to the North hand EXCEPT in <span class="red">&diams;</span>s, so you want to 
		win your <span class="red">&diams;</span>A on the trick that South plays his last <span class="red">&diams;</span>.<br>
		How can you tell which trick that is?		
		<br><br>
		Only by watching what West plays. On the <span class="red">&diams;</span>J West played the <span class="red">&diams;</span>2, 
		a low card signaling that he held an ODD number of <span class="red">&diams;</span>s.<br>
		ODD must be either one or three so when he followed to the next <span class="red">&diams;</span> you 
		know he started with three.<br>
		A little bit of counting tells you that South started with the doubleton Jack, 
		so you want to win the second <span class="red">&diams;</span> trick.
		<br><br>
		This defense holds South to one <span class="red">&diams;</span> tricks, if you had let him win the second 
		one he would have had 9 tricks.
