<b>Roman Key Card Blackwood - 1430 version</b>
<br><br>
RKCB is similar to Blackwood, but instead of four Aces there are Five Keycards. They are 
the Aces plus the King of the agreed trump suit. Starting with 4NT, a reply of 5&clubs; shows 1 or 4 Keycards, 
5<span class="red">&diams;</span> shows 0 or 3, 5<span class="red">&hearts;</span> shows 2 
Keycards but no trump Queen, and 5&spades; shows 2 Keycards with the trump Queen.
<br>
If your side has all five Keycards, bidding 5NT will repeat the process for Kings, remembering that there 
are only three Kings since the trump King is counted as a Keycard. There are two popular methods for 
responding to 5NT. The first is the same as normal Blackwood - 6&clubs; shows no Kings, 
6<span class="red">&diams;</span> shows one, and 6<span class="red">&hearts;</span> shows three. This is 
the method used in the recommended bidding here. <br>
If the response to 4NT is 5&clubs; or 5<span class="red">&diams;</span> the 4NT bidder may choose to ask 
about the trump Queen rather than ask for Kings. She does this by bidding the cheapest non-trump suit. 
Partner denies the trump Queen by returning to the trump suit. A 5NT bid confirms the trump Queen, but 
shows no outside Kings. Bidding any non-trump suit confirms the trump Queen and also the King of the suit 
bid.
<br>
Void showing by Responder is handled just as in regular Blackwood except it refers to one or two Keycards, rather 
than one or two Aces.
