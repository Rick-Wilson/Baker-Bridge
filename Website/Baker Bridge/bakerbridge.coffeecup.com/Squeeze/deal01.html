		Now you play the &clubs;A. At this point you are still hoping the &spades;s 
		will split 3-3. They aren't going to, as you see, but something wonderful happens instead. East 
		cannot discard his <span class="red">&hearts;</span>J because to do so would establish your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>2. 
		So he must throw a &spades; instead. You realize your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>2 is not a 
		winner so you just play &spades;K, &spades;A and &spades;Q, and amazingly dummy's 
		&spades;3 has become your thirteenth trick.
		<br><br>
		Of course if East had discarded his <span class="red">&hearts;</span>J you would have cashed your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>2 
		and then taken three &spades; winners.

		You just executed a Squeeze Play and you didn't even have to try.

		This type of squeeze is called an <i><b>automatic squeeze</b></i> because it operates equally well
