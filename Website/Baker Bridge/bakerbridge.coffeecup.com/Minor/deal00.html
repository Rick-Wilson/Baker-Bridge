<h3>MINOR SUIT OPENINGS</h3>
<br>

<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>

You may be either Opener or Responder, but you will always be in the South position.<br>
It is assumed that you are NOT playing the 2-Over-1 Game Force methods.
<br><br>
The first page or two of each Deal shows only your hand. The initial bidding is given and you are asked to decide 
what you would bid, then click<font style="color:#000099">&nbsp;<b>BID</b>&nbsp;</font>. 
The subsequent page will then appear telling you what you should have bid and continuing the auction. 
On the final page of each Deal partner's hand will be shown.
<br><br>
Although it is not included in the Deals you might wish to examine your and dummy's hand and make a Plan 
of how you would play the contract.
<br><br><br>

<b>MINOR SUIT OPENINGS LESSON</b>
<br><br>
It takes 11 tricks to make game in a Minor suit: 5<span class="red">&diams;</span> or 5&clubs;.<br>
And to make those 11 tricks you will need about 29 points between you and partner.<br>
Since it only takes about 26 points to make game in a Major suit or in notrump there is a 
tendency to avoid bidding games in the Minor suits. 
A lot of Minor suit bidding is actually aimed toward finding a Major fit or finding out if the 
partnership can play notrump.
<br><br>

To open a Major suit you are required to have 13-21 points and at least a 5-card suit.<br>
To open a Minor suit only the 13-21 point requirement applies. 
It would be nice if you had at least 4 cards in the Minor suit you open, but sometimes 
even that is not possible and you must open with a 3-card suit. 
You can see why Minor suit bidding is usually directed toward the Majors or Notrump!
<br><br>

You can probably tell from the above that opening 1<span class="red">&diams;</span> or 1&clubs; is sort of secondary.<br>
When you pick up a hand that looks pretty good you should first check to see if it qualifies  
to open 1&spades; or 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> (5-card suit, 13-21 points). If not, then see if you have 
the requirements to open 1NT (balanced, 15-17 points). If neither of these two options apply, then 
with 13-21 points you open 1<span class="red">&diams;</span> or 1&clubs;.
<br><br>

Here is how you decide which Minor suit to open:
<br><br>

With Minors of different length open the longest one.
<br>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	&spades; 10 6 2<br>
	<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 4 3<br>
	<span class="red">&diams;</span> A K 6<br>
	&clubs; A J 6 5 2 
	</td>
	<td>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hand has 13 points so you must open. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too weak to open 1NT and does not have<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a 5-card Major. Since there is a 5-card and<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a 3-card Minor, you open the 5-card. Bid 1&clubs;.<br>
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<br>
With only one 4-card minor open in that suit:

<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	&spades; Q J 5 2<br>
	<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K 6 3<br>
	<span class="red">&diams;</span> A 6<br>
	&clubs; K J 9 2 
	</td>
	<td>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you have 14 points so you must open. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the hand does not qualify to open 1NT<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or 1&spades;.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open one of your 4-card Minor, 1&clubs;.<br>
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
With two 4-card Minors, open 1<span class="red">&diams;</span>:
<br>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	&spades; K 5 2<br>
	<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K 3<br>
	<span class="red">&diams;</span> A 7 6 4<br>
	&clubs; K J 9 2 
	</td>
	<td>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 14 points and 4 cards in<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both &clubs;s and <span class="red">&diams;</span>s.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case you open 1<span class="red">&diams;</span>.
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
With two 3-card Minors, open 1&clubs;:
<br>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	&spades; A J 2<br>
	<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 9 8 7 6<br>
	<span class="red">&diams;</span> A Q 6<br>
	&clubs; Q 10 2 
	</td>
	<td>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 13 points so you must open.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have no 5-card Major and no 4-card Minor.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two 3-card minors you open 1&clubs;.<br>
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
With one 3-card Minor and one 2-card Minor, open the 3-card Minor:
<br>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	&spades; A J 4 2<br>
	<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 9 8 7 6<br>
	<span class="red">&diams;</span> A Q 6<br>
	&clubs; K 2 
	</td>
	<td>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This only happens when you are 4-4 in the Majors.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have 3 of one Minor and 2 of the other Minor.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always open with the 3-card Minor.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this hand you would open 1<span class="red">&diams;</span><br>
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
This last hand illustrates a very important principle:
<br><br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
 <tr>
  <td><span style='font-family:Arial'>
  &nbsp;NEVER OPEN IN A 2-CARD SUIT&nbsp;
  </span></td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<b>Responder's bid:</b>
<br><br>

Responding to partner's 1<span class="red">&diams;</span> or 1&clubs; opening is different from responding to a Major 
suit opening in one <b><font size="+2">HUGE</font></b> respect. The first priority 
in responding to 1 of a Major is telling partner if you have an 8 card fit in her suit. 
The first priority in responding to 1 of a Minor is to <b>try to find</b> an 8 card Major suit fit. 
<br><br>

If it turns out there is not a Major suit fit, then the second priority is to try to discover 
if the hands can be played at notrump.
<br><br>

Only after giving up on these first two priorities should you think about playing in a Minor suit.
<br><br>

There are several bidding rules to follow when responding to partner's Minor suit opening bid.
<br><br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">

 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>&nbsp;6 - 10 pts&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp;1) bid a new 4+ card suit at the 1-level<br>
			&nbsp;2) bid 1NT (even without a balanced hand)<br>

 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>&nbsp;11+ pts&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp;bid a new 4+ card suit at the 1 or 2-level</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>&nbsp;13 - 16 pts&nbsp;</td>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to play notrump when there is no Major suit fit.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A response of 3<span class="red">&diams;</span> is probably called for here.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hope the partner can bid 3NT, or perhaps he will<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bid 3&spades; and you can then bid 3NT. Or, it may turn out<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that partner has the type of hand he can bid 5<span class="red">&diams;</span> with.<br>
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
<br>
Sometimes it will happen that responder has a choice of two suits.
<br><br>

With two 4-card suits, bid the lower one first, “up-the-line”.<br>
Suppose partner opens 1&clubs; and you hold:
<br><br>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	&spades; A 10 8 5<br>
	<span class="red">&hearts;</span> J 10 6 3<br>
	<span class="red">&diams;</span> 7 6 2<br>
	&clubs; Q 2 
	</td>
	<td>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have 7 points and 4 cards in each Major suit.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should bid 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> (up the line) even though the<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; suit is stronger.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this is that partner still has room<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to bid 1&spades; if he holds 4 of them.<br>
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

With two 5-card suits, bid the higher one first.<br>
Suppose partner opens 1&clubs; and you hold:
<br><br>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	&spades; A 10 8 7 5<br>
	<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K Q 7 6 2<br>
	<span class="red">&diams;</span> 6 3<br>
	&clubs; 2 
	</td>
	<td>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have 11 points and two 5-card suits.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should bid 1&spades; (the higher ranking suit).<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if partner should bid 1NT you would say 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.<br>
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

With one 5-card and one 4-card suit, bid the longer one first.<br>
Suppose partner opens 1&clubs; and you hold: 
<br><br>

<table>
	<tr>
	<td>
	&spades; A 10 8 7 5<br>
	<span class="red">&hearts;</span> Q 6 3<br>
	<span class="red">&diams;</span> K 7 6 2<br>
	&clubs; 2 
	</td>
	<td>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have 10 points, a 5-card and a 4-card suit.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should bid 1&spades; (the 5-card suit).<br>
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

<b>Opener's rebid:</b>
<br><br>

As the partnership gains information in the bidding there will come a time when one of them 
figures out where the best final contract should be. When that happens, that partner should 
go ahead and put the contract there, perhaps by bidding game, perhaps by just passing. 
There is a good saying in bridge that makes this point:
<br><br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
 <tr>
  <td>
  &nbsp;HE WHO KNOWS, GOES&nbsp;
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br><br>

Look at this example:<br>
Opener's hand:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&spades; A K J 2&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K 10 8 3&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="red">&diams;</span> A K J 6&nbsp;&nbsp;
&clubs; 2 
<br>

<table width="30%">
	<tr><td align="center"><b>Opener</b></td><td align="center"><b>Responder</b></td></tr>
	<tr><td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="center"><b>?</b></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<br>

Here is what Opener knows:<br>
She knows that she has 19 points (plus 2 more for the singleton &clubs;).<br>
She knows that Partner has at least 6 points and at least 4 &spades;s.
<br><br>

Putting this information together she knows that together the partnership holds at least 
27 points and at least 8 &spades;s.  Since that is enough points for game and since 
they have an 8-card (or more) fit in &spades;s, she bids 4&spades;.<br>
<b>SHE WHO KNOWS, GOES.</b>
<br><br>

Another example:<br>
Opener's hand:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&spades; A K J 2&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> Q J 8 3&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="red">&diams;</span> A 10 7 6&nbsp;&nbsp;
&clubs; 2 
<br>

<table width="30%">
	<tr><td align="center"><b>Opener</b></td><td align="center"><b>Responder</b></td></tr>
	<tr><td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="center"><b>?</b></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<br>

Here is what Opener knows:<br>
She knows that she has 15 points (plus 2 more for the singleton &clubs;).<br>
She knows that Partner has at least 6 points and at least 4 &spades;s.
<br><br>

Putting this information together she knows that together the partnership holds at least 
23 points and a least 8 &spades;s.  They <b>may</b> have enough points to bid game 
in &spades;s, but since opener doesn't know for sure she just describes her hand further. 
She bids 3&spades; which lets partner know that they have a 
&spades; fit, 
and that her opening hand strength is in the middle of the 13-21 point range, either 16, 17 or 18. 
The 3&spades; bid is called an <b>invitational</b> bid.
It <b>invites</b> partner to bid game if he has more than just a minimum response.
Responder will pass if he has 6 or 7 points, but will bid 4&spades; if he has 9 or more.
<br><br>

A final example:<br>
Opener's hand:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&spades; A K J 2&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> J 8 4&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="red">&diams;</span> A 10 7 6&nbsp;&nbsp;
&clubs; 9 2 
<br>

<table width="30%">
	<tr><td align="center"><b>Opener</b></td><td align="center"><b>Responder</b></td></tr>
	<tr><td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="center"><b>?</b></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<br>

Here is what Opener knows:<br>
She knows that she has 13 points (plus 1 more for the doubleton &clubs;).<br>
She knows that Partner has at least 6 points and at least 4 &spades;s.
<br><br>

Putting this information together she knows that together the partnership holds at least 
20 points and a least 8 &spades;s.  They may have enough points to bid game in &spades;s, 
but since opener doesn't know for sure she just describes her hand further. 
She bids 2&spades; which lets partner know that they have a &spades; fit, 
and that her opening hand strength is in the bottom of the 13-21 point range, either 13, 14 or 15. 
Responder will then pass if he has 6-11 points, but will bid 4&spades; if he has 12 or more.
<br><br>

Notice that in all three of these examples both partners kept thinking about the 26 point 
requirement for bidding a Major suit game. All their bids were made to describe their hands 
as accurately as possible so they could reach the best contract without bidding too much.
<br>
<br>

<b>Summing up:</b>
<br><br>

There are many more bidding situations than could ever be put in a lesson.<br>
That's why Bridge is such a wonderful game!  So you bid in a way that sticks to the 
guidelines, and describes your hand as well as you can.
<br><br>

Both partners should be constantly rechecking their hands to see how their cards fit in with 
their partner's bidding. When it is your turn to bid, if you know enough to place the final 
contract then you should do so; perhaps by bidding a game or slam, perhaps by merely passing. 
If you cannot place the final contract then you should make a bid that gives partner more 
information in the hope that he will be able to place the contract.
<br><br>

<b>Always keep these in the back of your mind:</b>      
<br><br>
It takes 26 points for game in Notrump or a Major, 29 points for game in a Minor.
<br><br>
It takes 33 points for slam.
<br><br>
You need an 8-card fit to play a suit contract.
<br><br>
You must have at least 13 points to open with 1 of a suit.
<br><br>
You must have at least 6 points to make any response.
<br><br>
You must have at least 11 points to bid a new suit at the 2-level.
<br><br>
You must have at least 5 cards to open a Major suit.
<br><br>
You must have at least 3 cards to open a Minor suit.
<br><br>
You must have at least 4 cards to bid a suit as responder.
<br><br>
You must have at least 4 cards to bid a second suit as opener.
<br><br>
20 examples will be worth more than another 1000 words.
