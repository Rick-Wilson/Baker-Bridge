<h3>NEW MINOR FORCING</h3>
<br>

<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>
You may be either Opener or Responder, but you will always be in the South position.
<br><br>
The first few pages of each Deal show only your hand. The initial bidding (if any) is given and you are asked 
to decide what you would bid, then click <font style="color:#000099">&nbsp;<b>BID</b>&nbsp;</font>. 
The next page will then appear telling you what you should have bid and continuing the auction. 
On the final page of each Deal partner's hand will be shown.
<br><br>
Although it is not a part of the Deals you might wish to examine your and dummy's hand and make a Plan 
of how you would play the contract.
<br><br><br>

<b>NEW MINOR FORCING SUMMARY</b>
<br><br>
In standard bidding a new suit by Responder at his second turn is forcing for 
one round, <b>EXCEPT</b> when Opener's rebid was 1NT.
<br><br>

<table>
<tr><td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
		<td width="100">&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td>
		<td align="center">or</td>
		<td align="center">1&clubs;</td><td align="center">1<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2<span class="red">&diams;</span></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

Your second bid is not forcing and partner is expected to either pass or give preference back 
to your first suit.<br>
For the first example your hand might be:
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; Q J 9 8 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K J 7 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> 7 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 4 2
<br><br><br>

That is just fine when you do have a weak hand. But consider this:
<br><br>

<table>
<tr><td align="center">&nbsp;<b>Pard</b>&nbsp;</td><td align="center"><b>&nbsp;You</b>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">???</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; A K 9 8 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K 9 7
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> 7 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; A 10 9
<br><br>

With 14 points you know you must get to game somewhere. You could just jump to 3NT but if 
you did so and partner turned out to have a 3-card &spades; support you might 
go down at 3NT when 4&spades; was a laydown.
<br><br>
 
What you need is a bid that will force partner to bid again, and to give you some more information 
about his hand as he does so. And thus was New Minor Forcing created.
<br><br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
	<tr><td align="center">
	Following a 1NT rebid by Opener, Responder's bid<br>
	of a previously unbid minor suit	is artificial and forcing.<br>
	Opener is requested to further describe his hand.</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

There are exactly six possibilities:
<br><br>

<table>
<tr><td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
		<td width="75">&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
		<td width="75">&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">1&clubs;</td><td align="center">1<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td>
		<td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td>
		<td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2<span class="red">&diams;</span></td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2&clubs;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2&clubs;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<table>
<tr><td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
		<td width="75">&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
		<td width="75">&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">1&clubs;</td><td align="center">1&spades;</td>
		<td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td>
		<td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2<span class="red">&diams;</span></td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2&clubs;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2<span class="red">&diams;</span></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

In all these cases your second bid of 2&clubs; or 2<span class="red">&diams;</span> is forcing.
<br><br><br>

But in these sequences,
<table>
<tr><td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
		<td width="75">&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">1&clubs;</td><td align="center">1&spades;</td>
		<td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td>
</tr>
</table>
your 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> bid is not forcing because it isn't a minor.
<br><br><br>

<b>Requirements for New Minor Forcing:</b>
<br><br>

The first requirement is a little caution.<br>
Partner's 1NT rebid has put his hand at 12-14 points. 
Perhaps he could have a 15 point hand that for some reason he couldn't open 1NT, but that is stretching 
his bid. So you need to have a hand that is good enough to force him to bid again. Some partnerships 
insist on an opening hand for you, but most play that a good 11 points should be the minimum strength.
<br><br>

And of course you should also have the type of hand that can't be described by a natural bid.
<br><br>

Assume this bidding sequence for the examples below:
<table>
<tr><td align="center">&nbsp;<b>Pard</b>&nbsp;</td><td align="center"><b>&nbsp;You</b>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1&clubs;</td><td align="center">1&spades;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2<span class="red">&diams;</span></td></tr>
</table>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; A K 7 5 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K 9 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> 10 9
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; K 6 4<br>
You know you want to be in game but are unsure whether 3NT or 4&spades; is best.<br>
So you bid 2<span class="red">&diams;</span> (NMF) to force partner to bid again.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; K Q 8 7 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A Q J 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> 8 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 6 4<br>
You can't bid 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> because partner would pass and you know you should be in game.<br>
A jump to 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> shows a 5-card suit.<br>
Again, the solution is to bid 2<span class="red">&diams;</span> which partner cannot pass.
<br><br><br>

<b>Opener's third bid:</b>
<br><br>

Opener's first two bids have already described his hand very well, so there isn't much more to be said. 
But Responder has asked for more information, so Opener bids again with the following priorities:

<ol>
  <li>Show a 4-card <span class="red">&hearts;</span> suit.</li>
  <li>Show 3-card support for Responder's first suit.</li>
  <li>Bid notrump with stoppers in the unbid suits.</li>
  <li>Raise partner's "new minor suit" with at least 4 card support.</li>
  <li>Rebid your 5-card minor suit if no other bid is possible.</li>
</ol>

Opener may also be able to say something about his strength. Since the hand is somewhere in the 
12-15 point range he can make a minimum bid with 12-13 and jump with 14-15. This is strictly a 
partnership thing, if you don't want to incorporate it then NMF will work just fine without it.
<br><br>

Assume this bidding sequence for the examples below:
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<b>You</b>&nbsp;</td><td><b>&nbsp;Pard</b>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1NT</td><td align="center">2&clubs;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">??</td><td align="center"></td></tr>
</table>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; 6 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K 9 7 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q J 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; A 10 3
<br>
Bid 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>. This is your top priority.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; 10 6 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A 9
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q 10 6 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; Q 10 3
<br>
Bid 2&spades;. This shows 3 cards in the suit.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; A 6 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 10 9 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q J 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; A 8 3
<br>
Bid 3&spades;. This shows 3 cards, but with maximum strength.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; 6 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A Q 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q J 9 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 10 8 3
<br>
Bid 2NT. This shows a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> stopper, but fewer than 3 &spades;s.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; 6 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 10 8 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> A K Q 9
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; A 10 8 3
<br>
Bid 3&clubs;. This shows 4 &clubs;s, fewer than 3 &spades;s 
and an unwillingness to play notrump (no <span class="red">&hearts;</span> stopper).
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; 6 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 10 8 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> A K J 9 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; A 10 3
<br>
Bid 2<span class="red">&diams;</span>. You hate to rebid a 5-card suit but partner has forced you to bid 
and none of the other choices are possible.
<br><br><br>

<b>New Minor Forcing after 2NT:</b>
<br><br>

If Opener's second bid is a jump to 2NT that shows a balanced 18-19 point hand. Responder can 
use New Minor Forcing to find the best contract.
<br><br>

Assume this bidding sequence for the examples below:
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<b>Pard</b>&nbsp;</td><td><b>&nbsp;You</b>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1&clubs;</td><td align="center">1&spades;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">2NT</td><td align="center">3<span class="red">&diams;</span></td></tr>
</table>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; K Q 10 5 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 9 6 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> A 8 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 5 2<br>
You know you want to be in game but are unsure whether 3NT or 4&spades; is best.<br>
So you bid 3<span class="red">&diams;</span> (NMF) to force partner to bid again.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; K Q J 7 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 10 7 6 4<br>
You are probably going to bid a slam, either 6NT or 6&spades;.<br>
Bid 3<span class="red">&diams;</span> to ask partner if he has 3 &spades;s.
<br><br><br>



<b>And then what?</b>
<br><br>

And then it's up to you. New Minor Forcing is complete after those two bids. From that point one 
of the partners, probably Responder, should be able to choose a contract. All subsequent bidding 
is just your normal bidding system.
<br><br>

If the opponents interfere you should play that NMF is off and all bids have natural meanings.

<br><br><br>
14 examples will be worth more than another 14000 words.
