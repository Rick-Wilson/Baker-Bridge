		You are West. The bidding has been as shown.
		<br><br>
		You lead the &clubs;Q, East plays low and South wins the &clubs;A.
		<br><br>
		South pulls trumps in 2 rounds.<br>
		He then takes the <span class="red">&diams;</span>K, <span class="red">&diams;</span>Q, <span class="red">&diams;</span>A, discarding a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> on the last one.<br>
		Next he plays dummy's last &clubs; to his &clubs;K.
		<br><br>
		Having done all this, South now plays a low <span class="red">&hearts;</span> from his hand.<br>
		What do you play?

		Play the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A.
		<br><br>
		If you followed what South was doing you will realize that he has eliminated both 
		the <span class="red">&diams;</span>s and &clubs;s from both his hand and dummy. 
		If it isn't clear that he is now out of &clubs;s, just 
		remember the bidding - he must have had 5 &spades;s and 4 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s.
		<br><br>
		Suppose you play low on this <span class="red">&hearts;</span> (as South hopes you will).<br>
		Dummy's <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K will take the trick, and when another <span class="red">&hearts;</span> is played you will have to win it with your 
		now bare <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A. 
		You will then have to play a <span class="red">&diams;</span> or a &clubs;, giving South a ruff and sluff.
		<br><br>
		But if you take your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A now, then exit with your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>2, South can win the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K but will still 
		have to lose a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> to East.
