		You are West. The bidding has been as shown.
		<br><br>
		You decide a trump lead is called for and lead the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>2.<br>
		Your partner wins with the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A and plays 
		the <span class="red">&diams;</span>J.<br>
		South lets this go to dummy's <span class="red">&diams;</span>K, (but you know he 
		has <span class="red">&diams;</span>Q), then plays a trump back 
		to his <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K, pulling the 2 outstanding trumps from West and East.
		<br><br>
		South's next play is the &spades;3 from his hand.<br>
		Do you play your &spades;A or not?
		<br><br>
		When you have made your choice click<a href="#2">&nbsp;<b>NEXT</b>&nbsp;</a>.

		Play the &spades;A.
		<br><br>
		Even if South doesn't have the &spades;K he can establish a &spades; winner just by leading twice toward 
		the &spades; Q J. That winner will take care of whatever black-suit loser he may have.
		<br><br>
		If East has a &clubs; trick it is important to get it established soon.<br>
		So go up with the &spades;A and play a &clubs; through dummy's &clubs; A Q.<br>
		When South tries the &spades; suit again <b>EAST</b> can win and cash his &clubs;K for the setting trick.
		<br><br>
		If you play low on South's &spades; play East will be forced to win the trick and he cannot profitably 
		attack the &clubs; suit from his side.
