		Play the &spades;J (or &spades;Q).
		<br><br>
		You should always make a point count check as soon as you see dummy.<br>
		South's 2NT promises 20 or 21 points, North has 14 and you have 3; total = 37 or 38.<br>
		Therefore West must have either 2 or 3 points. He cannot have two Jacks because you can 
		see all four of them. Likewise he cannot have a Queen because you can see three of them 
		and his <span class="red">&hearts;</span> lead (top of nothing) denied that Queen.
		<br><br>
		It follows that West <b>MUST</b> have a King, and it must be &clubs;s or 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span>s since he has denied any <span class="red">&hearts;</span> Honor.
		<br><br>
		Since West will definitely win his King, you need to take one trick yourself, and the best way to 
		do that is to split your Honors to establish one &spades; winner.
		<br><br>
		South has no defense to this, but if you had played low he would have played the &spades;10 
		and made the slam.
