		You are East. The bidding has been as shown, (wild).
		<br><br>
		Partner led the <span class="red">&diams;</span>J; <span class="red">&diams;</span>Q from dummy, 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span>K from you and ruffed by South.
		<br><br>
		South then pulls two rounds of trumps, (West discards on the second one), followed by his &spades;Q, 
		dummy's &spades; A K and dummy's <span class="red">&diams;</span>A.<br>
		South discards &clubs;s on the last two cards.
		<br><br>
		The &clubs;6 is then played from dummy and you must make a decision - &clubs;A or &clubs;2?
		<br><br>
		When you have made your choice click<a href="#2">&nbsp;<b>NEXT</b>&nbsp;</a>.

		Play the &clubs;2.
		<br><br>
		You have a full count on South's hand.<br>
		He started with 2 &spades;s, 7 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s, and no <span class="red">&diams;</span>s.<br>
		His other 4 cards must have been &clubs;s, and he has discarded 2 of them.
		<br><br>
		So he has 2 &clubs;s left in his hand. If one of them is the &clubs;K and you play your &clubs;A then you 
		have handed him the contract.
		<br><br>
		By playing low you give him a guess to make.<br>
		If he plays the &clubs;K he will make the contract, but if he plays the &clubs;J he will go down.<br>
		He will probably play the &clubs;J, figuring you woudn't have the nerve to duck with the &clubs;A.<br>
		He'll know better next time he plays against you.
