		This Deal took a lot of care and attention. As you can see you had to take one &clubs; finesse 
		before you drew trumps because you were in your hand right then and you could only get back one more time.
		<br><br>
		But also you had to play to one of dummy's honors first so you could retain that &clubs;5 
		for letting you stay in your hand to make the third finesse. Bridge is great.
