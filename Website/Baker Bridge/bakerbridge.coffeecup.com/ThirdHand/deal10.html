		Play the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q.
		<br><br>
		The Rule of Eleven tells you there are 6 cards in North, East and South that are higher 
		than the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>5. You can see 5 of them, so that leaves just 
		one of them for South.
		<br><br>
		West cannot have all three of the outstanding honors, because from 
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K J 10 x x his correct lead would be the Jack.<br>
		So you can deduce that South must hold exactly one of <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K, 
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span>J, or <span class="red">&hearts;</span>10.
		<br><br>
		If his honor is not the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K then it won't matter whether 
		you play <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A or <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q to the first 
		trick; you will win your two top cards and then play your small one back to West.
		<br><br>
		So assume South actually holds the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K x x.<br>
		If you play the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A to trick one, then lead 
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q, South will hold up on the second trick, and win the 
		third <span class="red">&hearts;</span>. Then, when you win your &clubs;K you will not have 
		a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> to return to partner and declarer will make the contract.
		<br><br>
		So what happens if you play the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q at trick one?<br>
		South could still make the contract by holding up, <b>but he will be afraid to do so</b>. 
		After all, from his perspective it looks like West probably holds the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A 
		and he will be afraid of losing the first 5 <span class="red">&hearts;</span> tricks, perhaps 
		even when the &clubs;K finessing is working!
