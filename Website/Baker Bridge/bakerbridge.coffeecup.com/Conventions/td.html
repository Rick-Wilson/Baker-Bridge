		The Takeout Double has been around so long that many think of it as just a natural bid, not 
		a convention at all.
		<br><br>
		The purpose of the Takeout Double is to get your side into the bidding after the opposition has opened 
		with a suit bid. If you Double their bid it does not mean that you expect to defeat the contract, but 
		rather that you want your partner to name his best suit.
		<br><br>
		In the standard case the Takeout Doubler must have at least 13 points, (opening hand strength), no 
		more than 2 cards in the Opener's suit, and at least 3 cards in every other suit. The partner of 
		the Doubler must not pass, even with a weak hand. Instead he usually bids his best suit.
		<br><br>
		Doubler's partner should bid at the minimum level with fewer than 9 points, jump in a good suit with 
		10-11 points, and cue-bid the Opener's suit with 12 or more. The cue-bid reply forces the partnership to 
		game.
		<br><br>
		
		Each partnership must agree on when a double is for Takeout, and when it is for penalties. A workable 
		agreement is that doubling any suit opening bid up through 3&spades; is for Takeout.
		<br><br>
		
		A second, (less frequent), type of Takeout Double is used when you have a hand with a good 5-card or 
		longer suit and more than 16 points. After an opponent opens you are too strong to simply Overcall, because 
		partner might well pass with 9 or 10 points. Instead you Double, then at your next turn you bid your suit. 
		<br><br>
		
		A third, (even less frequent), type of Takeout Double is used when you have a 19-22 point balanced hand 
		with stoppers in the suit the opponent opens. In this case you double, then at your next turn bid Notrump.
		<br><br>
		
		Lesson available.
