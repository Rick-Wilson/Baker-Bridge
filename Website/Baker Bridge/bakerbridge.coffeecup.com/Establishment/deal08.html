		<br><br>
		You only need one more winner and you have several possibilities. The <span class="red">&hearts;</span> finesse might work, 
		or the &clubs;s might split 3-3. But you need to consider the defenders winners also. They have 
		already scored 2 <span class="red">&diams;</span> tricks and will get 2 more as soon as they gain the lead. (The spot 
		cards told you that West has a 5-card <span class="red">&diams;</span> suit.) Plus they have the 2 top &spades;s 
		which they can take whenever they like. So if your play sets up just one more trick for them you will go down.
		<br><br>
		No, you must establish &spades;s, the suit where they have 2 winners anyway. So you play a 
		&spades; which West wins. He takes his 2 <span class="red">&diams;</span>s but you are now home free. When 
		you gain the lead again you will get your &spades; winner established and only lose 2 &spades;s 
		and 4 <span class="red">&diams;</span>s.
