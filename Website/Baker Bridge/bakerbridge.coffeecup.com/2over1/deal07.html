		North has 13 points and naturally opens 1&spades;.
		<br><br>
		
		South, with 15 points, would bid 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> in standard bidding, but with 2/1 
		this promises a 5-card suit. So instead, South responds 2&clubs;, forcing the partnership to game.<br>
		Note that holding two 4-card minors South bids them up-the-line, just as in standard bidding.
		<br><br>
		
		North has a nice 6-card &spades; suit, so you might think he would rebid them. But Opener's first 
		responsibility with his second bid is to show a 4-card Major if he has one. This isn't much of a suit, but North still 
		bids 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.
		<br><br>
		
		You can see why it is important for Opener to show a 4-card Major. Since South couldn't bid 
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span>s in her first response the fit would have been lost if North had 
		not mentioned the suit. South now confirms the trump suit with a 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 
		bid, and North shows his minimum by just bidding the game.
