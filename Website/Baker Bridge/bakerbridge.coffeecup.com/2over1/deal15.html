		North opens 1&spades;.<br>
		South has 11 points, enough to respond 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> in standard bidding, but not 
		when using 2/1. So she bids 1NT.
		<br><br>
		
		North would love to pass 1NT but is not permitted to do so. He has no good bid, so he must bid a 
		3-card suit. When holding two 3-card minors, usually bid &clubs;s.<br>
		South now shows the <span class="red">&hearts;</span> suit that she could not bid first round.
		<br><br>
		 
		North was forced to reply to 1NT, but he is not forced to bid again. With his minimum hand 
		and a tolerance for partner's suit he just passes and the partnership ends up in a reasonable contract.
		<br><br>
		
		This hand demonstrates one of the benefits of Forcing 1NT. In standard bidding South's first response 
		would be 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>, and North would have to bid again, probably 2NT. The 
		partnership might go even higher but in any case would probably not reach a good contract.
