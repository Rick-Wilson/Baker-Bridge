		North opens 1&spades;.<br>
		South responds 2<span class="red">&diams;</span>, a 2/1 force to game. 
		<br><br>
		
		North's priority is to now show the 4-card <span class="red">&hearts;</span> suit. Remember that South 
		might also have 4 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s.
		<br><br>
		 
		South doesn't have 4 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s, nor does she have 3 &spades;s. Furthermore,  
		she does not have stoppers in &clubs;s so she cannot bid NT. Since she has to keep bidding, but has 
		no reasonable bid she can make, she bids the fourth suit, 3&clubs;. Compare this Deal with Deal 21.
		<br><br>
		
		North understands that South's &clubs; bid is Fourth-Suit-Forcing, and does not actually show &clubs;s. 
		However since North does have a &clubs; stopper he bids 3NT. In this case this turns out to be the 
		best game contract.
