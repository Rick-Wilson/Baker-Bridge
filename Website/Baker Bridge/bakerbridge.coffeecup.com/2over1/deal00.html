<h3>2/1</h3>


The 2-Over-1 Game Force (2/1) is the biggest thing in the Bridge world since 5-card Majors. 
It has been around since the nineties, but Bridge innovations take a while to filter down from 
the expert level, so it has only recently become popular among Club players.

<br><br>
2/1 is more than just a Convention, but less than a complete new bidding System.  
It is an improvement to the standard 5-card Major system that most of us know and love. 
When you start using 2/1 you will find that most of your bidding stays just the same as it always 
has been. Your bidding after a 1NT opener doesn't change at all. Neither does your treatment of 
strong 2&clubs; bids, nor Weak 2's and preempts. All of your competitive bidding, overcalls and 
takeout doubles, stays just as you have it now.
<br><br>

In fact, there are only two aspects of your bidding that need to be modified.<br>
The first modification, (and the name of the game), is the strength requirement to make a 2-level suit response 
to partner's opening 1 of a suit.
<br><br>
In standard methods you need 11 or more points and the bid is forcing for one round.
<br><br>
Using 2/1 you must have 13 or more points and the bid is forcing to game.
<br><br>
That may not seem like a big deal, but it is. When both partners learn in the first round of bidding 
that they are going to reach a game it eliminates most jump bids and keeps the bidding at a lower level 
while information is exchanged.
<br><br>

Be sure you understand that 2/1 applies <b>ONLY</b> to these six sequences:
<br><br>

<div class="box">
This lesson applies to those six bidding sequences.<br>
BUT, many 2/1 players only consider five of those sequences as 2/1. 
They exclude the 1<span class="red">&diams;</span> - 2&clubs; sequence and use the 2/1 Game Force only 
after an opening bid of one-of-a-Major.
<br><br>
You may prefer to do it that way. If so, the 1<span class="red">&diams;</span> - 2&clubs; sequence is treated 
just as you are presently doing; Responder needs 11+ points, and it is forcing just for 1 round.

<b>OPENER'S REBID</b>
<br><br>

You will find this to be the easiest part of 2/1.<br>
Easy because the rebids are always natural, and are mostly pretty obvious.<br>
Here they are in priority order:
<br><br>

<b>Bid 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> if partner bid <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s and you have 3 or more.</b>
<br><br>


<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:7em">
&spades; A 9 8 7 4<br>
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 10 9 3<br>
<span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q 2<br>
&clubs; A 4
</td><td>
The only 2/1 sequence where this can occur (immediate support with just 3 trumps) is when 
you open 1&spades; and partner responds 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.<br>
Bid 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> because you know there is an 8-card Major fit 
since partner's bid promises a 5-card <span class="red">&hearts;</span> suit.
</td></tr></table>
<br>

<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:7em">
&spades; A Q 9 8 7 4<br>
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 10 9 3<br>

&clubs; A 4
</td><td>
Again you open 1&spades; and partner responds 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.<br>
Bid 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> because you know there is an 8-card Major fit.<br>
Notice that even with 6 &spades;s your priority is to immediately establish the 8-card fit as trump.
</td></tr></table>
<br>

<b>Bid a new Major suit with a 4+ card suit.</b>

</td><td>
You open 1&spades; and partner responds 2&clubs;.<br>
Bid 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>. Partner may well have a 4-card <span class="red">&hearts;</span>

</td><td>
You open 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> and partner responds 2&clubs;.<br>
Bid 2&spades; . 
In Standard bidding you would not make this bid since it is a reverse and your hand 
doesn't have the required strength. Playing 2/1, when the partnership is already forced 
to game, reverses do not require extra strength. The 2&spades; bid might uncover a &spades; fit 
since partner might have 5 &clubs;s and 4 &spades;s. Even if it doesn't, it shows partner 
where your strength lies so he can bid 3NT.

One caution applies here.<br>
Try to avoid introducing a new suit at the 3-level unless you have

2-level if you can.
</td></tr></table>
<br>

None of the Opener rebids above were jumps. Opener does not need to make a jump rebid to show extra strength 
at this point. Since you are already forced to reach game you should bid slowly to first find out 
<i><b>where</b></i> you want to play, and worry about <i><b>how high</b></i> you want to go later.

<br><br><br>


<b>RESPONDER'S SECOND BID</b>
<br><br>
By the time Responder's second bid comes around you <b>MAY</b> have already agreed upon a trump suit.<br>
The most likely 2/1 sequence for this to occur is this one:<br>

<table class="bidding">
<tr><td style="width:5em"><b>OPEN</b><br>1&spades;<br>3<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td>
<td style="width:5em"><b>RESP</b><br>2<span class="red">&hearts;</span><br>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<br>

Here are various other scenarios.
<br><br>

<b>Responder's first priority is to agree on the trump suit (or notrump) with this bid.</b>

<td>
Bid 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.<br>
You could not respond 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> initially with only 4 of them. 
When partner bids <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s you immediately agree, setting the trump suit. 
You might well decide to say 4<span class="red">&hearts;</span> instead of 3, (see Fast Arrival below), but 
you don't need to worry that partner will pass you at the 3-level. She cannot, you are forced to game.

<b>FURTHER BIDDING BY BOTH PARTNERS</b>
<br><br>
Always keep in your mind that after a 2/1 sequence the partnership is forced to reach game.<br> 
This leads to an important idea, <b>The Principle of Fast Arrival.</b>


<div class="box">
<b>THE PRINCIPLE OF FAST ARRIVAL</b><br>
When the partners are agreed on <i><b>where</b></i> to play the hand, an immediate game bid by either 
parther indicates that the bidder has nothing extra and no particular interest in trying to get to slam.
</div>
<br>

Here is one brief example (more are included in the Example Deals):
<br><br>

<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:5em">
&spades; 9 3<br>
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A J 9 7 4<br>
<span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q 8<br>
&clubs; Q 9 4
</td><td style="width:6em; vertical-align:top;">
<table class="bidding">
<tr><td><b>OPEN</b><br>1&spades;<br>3<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td>
<td><b>RESP</b><br>2<span class="red">&hearts;</span><br>?</td></tr>
</table>
</td><td>
Bid 4<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.<br>
You have a minimum hand and no interest in going beyond the game which you have already forced.<br>
Don't think of this as a "shut-out" bid because partner is certainly entitled to continue on with 
a slam try of some sort. The 4<span class="red">&hearts;</span> bid is just the best description of 
your own hand.
</td></tr></table>
<br>


The flip-side of the Principle of Fast Arrival, (which should probably be called the Principle of 
Slow Arrival but for some reason nobody does), is that any other bid shows at least a little extra.
<br><br>
If you have agreed upon a suit, then "any other bid" would be a control-showing cue-bid. If you have agreed 
on notrump then "any other bid" would likely be a quantitative 4NT bid.
<br><br>
You don't need a lot extra to make this kind of bid.<br>
All it really means is that you have a hand good enough that you didn't want to invoke Fast Arrival.
<br><br>
Here's an example of the flip-side:
<br><br>

<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:5em;">
&spades; 9 3<br>
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A Q 9 7 4<br>
<span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q 8<br>
&clubs; A 9 4
</td><td style="width:6em; vertical-align:top;">
<table class="bidding">
<tr><td><b>OPEN</b><br>1&spades;<br>3<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td>
<td><b>RESP</b><br>2<span class="red">&hearts;</span><br>?</td></tr>
</table>
</td><td>
Bid 4&clubs;.<br>
This time you have a somewhat stronger hand.<br>
You aren't strong enough to start insisting on slam, but you are too good for Fast Arrival.<br>
So you show your first-round control in &clubs;s, which you can do without going beyond 
4<span class="red">&hearts;</span>. What happens next depends on partner; if he now just bids 
game you will pass happily, if he pursues slam you will cooperate.
</td></tr></table>
<br><br><br>


<b>WHEN 2/1 DOES NOT APPLY</b>
<br><br>

There are two situations where the 2/1 Game Force does not apply.
<br><br>
When Responder is a passed hand 2/1 is <b>OFF</b> for two reasons. First, since Responder passed originally 
he obviously does not have 13 points. Second, a third-seat Opener may have opened light. 
So in this situation you just revert to Standard bidding.
<br><br>
If the opponents interfere immediately after the opening bid then 2/1 is <b>OFF</b>. There are other ways 
to make game-forcing bids, such as a cue-bid of the overcalled suit. However, if the opponent in the 
fourth seat interferes, (after Responder has already made a 2/1 Response), then the game-force is still on.
<br><br>
Here are two Responder examples:
<br><br>

<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:5em">
&spades; 9 3<br>
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A J 9 7 4<br>

</table>
</td><td>
Bid 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.<br>
11 points is not strong enough for a normal 2/1 response.<br>
But since you have already passed partner knows you do not have 13 points.<br>
This bid now shows at least 11 points.
</td></tr></table>
<br>

<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:5em">
&spades; 9 3<br>

<td><b>RESP</b><br>?</td></tr>
</table>
</td><td>
Bid 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.<br>
11 points is not strong enough for a normal 2/1 response.<br>
But 2/1 is off because of the intervening bid.<br>
This response shows at least 11 points.
</td></tr></table>
<br><br><br>


<b>2/1 SUMMARY</b>
<br><br>

If partner opens 1&spades;, 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> or 1<span class="red">&diams;</span>*, 
a non-jump response of 2 of a new suit requires at least 13 points and is forcing to game.<br> 
The partnership must either reach a game or double the opponents.<br>
*Some pairs prefer to use 2/1 only when the opening bid is 1&spades; or 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.
<br><br>
If the opening bid is 1&spades;, Responder needs a 5-card or longer suit to respond 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.
<br><br>
The Principle of Fast Arrival applies; an immediate game bid denies slam interest.
<br><br>
If the Opener is third or fourth hand, (partner having started with a pass), 2/1 is OFF.
<br><br>
If an opponent interferes immediately after the opening bid, 2/1 is OFF.

<br><br><br>


<h3>FORCING 1NT RESPONSE</h3>


Way up at the top of the page it was mentioned that there are <b>TWO</b> aspects of your bidding that 
must change if you play 2/1.<br>
Here comes the second one.
<br><br>

In Standard bidding you must have 11 or more points to respond with a new suit at the 2-level.<br>
So in Standard bidding, if you hold a 6-10 point hand, you respond 1NT whether 
or not you have a balanced hand. In other words, a 1NT response is the catch-all.
<br><br>
In 2/1 bidding you must have at least 13 points to bid the new suit at the 2-level.
<br><br>
See the problem?<br>
How do you handle those 11-12 point hands which are too weak for a 2/1 response?<br>
The solution is to expand the catch-all 1NT response to 6-12 points.
<br><br>
Easy enough to do that, but the increased range creates a new problem.<br>
Suppose Opener has a relatively balanced 14-15 point hand.<br>
A 6-10 point 1NT response could be passed without fear of missing a game, but if the 1NT responder 
might have 11-12 points then Opener dare not pass because in this case there might well be a game!
<br><br>
So when you use 2/1, you must also use the Forcing 1NT response.


<div class="box">
<b>FORCING 1NT RESPONSE</b>
<br><br>
A 1NT response to a 1&spades; or 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> opening bid, 
in first or second seat, shows 6-12 points and is forcing for 1 round.
</div>
<br>
Look at some examples of a Forcing 1NT Response.
<br><br>

<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:5em">
&spades; 7 5 3<br>

</td><td>
Partner opens 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.<br>
With 11 points you are not quite strong enough to bid 2&clubs;.<br>
So you bid 1NT instead, which is forcing for one round.<br>
In standard bidding, of course, you would bid 2&clubs;.
</td></tr></table>

Partner opens 1&spades;.<br>

In standard bidding you would make the same bid; this is often the case.

&clubs; A J 6 4 3
</td><td>
Partner opens 1<span class="red">&diams;</span>.<br>
With 11 points you cannot bid 2&clubs;, that would be a 2/1 Game Force.<br>
But you are too strong to bid just 1NT, that would show 6-10 points and would not be forcing.<br>
So you jump to 2NT, inviting game.*
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
*Some comments are in order for this bidding sequence.
<br><br>
First, if you have decided to play 2/1 only after a Major suit opening then there is no problem, 
you just bid 2&clubs;.
<br><br>
Otherwise you have to deal with the situation when partner opens 1<span class="red">&diams;</span> and you 
have 11-12 points and a &clubs; suit.<br>
The preferred solution is to adopt the following procedure after a 
1<span class="red">&diams;</span> or 1&clubs; opening bid:<br>
• A jump to 2NT shows 11-12 points with no 4-card Major and is invitational.<br>
• A jump to 3NT shows balanced 13-15 points and is of course forcing to game.

You cannot support <span class="red">&diams;</span>s with only three cards in the suit.<br>
You are way too good to pass.<br>
When you do not have any call that is not a lie, you just choose the one that 
is the "smallest" lie. In this case, go ahead and bid 2&clubs;.

<b>OPENER'S REBID AFTER FORCING 1NT</b>
<br><br>

Most of the time Opener's rebid after Forcing 1NT response will be the same as it would have been after a 6-10 point
1NT response.<br>
Consider these examples:
<br><br>

<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:6em">

So you jump shift in your second suit.<br>
This is the bid you would make whether you play Forcing 1NT or not.
</td></tr></table>
<br><br>

Many other sequences will turn out the same in either method. The Practice Deals will show some of them.
<br><br>

The only time that Opener makes a rebid that is different from standard bidding is when he 
has a balanced minimum, 13-15 points, and only 5 cards in the opened (Major) suit.<br>
Playing a 6-10 point 1NT response Opener's rebid was simple - PASS.<br>
But playing Forcing 1NT response, Pass is no longer permitted, so some other action must be created.<br>
Consider these examples:
<br><br>

<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:6em">
&spades; A J 8 7 3<br>
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K 9 4<br>

<tr><td><b>OPEN</b><br>1&spades;<br>?</td>
<td><b>RESP</b><br>1NT<br></td></tr>
</table>
</td><td>
Bid 2<span class="red">&diams;</span>.<br>
With standard bidding you would happily pass 1NT.<br>
But now you can't. When you have to create a bid over a Forcing 1NT response, 
you are permitted to bid a 3-card minor suit. Responder, of course, must 
keep in mind that you might have bid a 3-card minor.
</td></tr></table>
<br>

<table class="hand"><tr><td style="width:6em">
&spades; A K 8 7 3<br>
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> K 4<br>

<table class="bidding">
<tr><td><b>OPEN</b><br>1&spades;<br>?</td>
<td><b>RESP</b><br>1NT<br></td></tr>
</table>
</td><td>
Bid 2&clubs;.<br>
When you have a choice of 3-card minors, choose &clubs;.<br>
These choices correspond to the choice you make when opening a 3-card minor.
</td></tr></table>
<br>

You might not like the thought of bidding a 3-card minor suit on the second round. 
That is particularly true when this is the very type of hand which you would love to just 
pass and let partner play 1NT. But when you play Forcing 1NT responses you have to get used to 
the idea that Responder will almost never get to play a 1NT contract - even if it turns out that would 
have been the best place for the partnership.
<br><br>
If you are thinking this is a huge drawback to Forcing 1NT, keep in mind that 1NT might not be 
the best landing place for these hands, even when Responder is weak.
<br><br>
Here are two possible scenarios built around that first example.
<br><br>

<table class="hand">
<tr>
<td style="width:6em">
<b>OPENER</b><br>

&clubs; 6 5 3
</td>
<td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:top;">
With standard bidding you would pass 1NT.<br>
As you can see, 1NT is a poor contract.<br>
Instead, with Forcing 1NT you would bid 2<span class="red">&diams;</span> which partner would pass.<br>
This turns out to be an excellent contract.
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">

<td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:top;">
With standard bidding you would pass 1NT.<br>
Again, 1NT is a poor contract.<br>
Instead, with Forcing 1NT you would bid 2<span class="red">&diams;</span>.<br>
Partner would then say 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> and you would pass, 
again reaching an excellent contract.
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
<table style="background-color:#d3d3a3">
<tr><td style="vertical-align:top; width:6em;">1&spades;<br>2<span class="red">&diams;</span><br>pass</td>
<td style="vertical-align:top; width:6em;">1NT<br>2<span class="red">&hearts;</span><br></td></tr>
</table>
</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

Those last two scenarios show off the positive aspects of Forcing 1NT response. But of course there are 
other scenarios which don't work out nearly as well. The thing to remember though, is that giving up 
the ability for Responder to play a 1NT contract is not all bad, plenty of times it works out for the 
best. And the advantages of using 2/1, (which must incluce Forcing 1NT response), are huge.
<br><br>
There is one thing Opener must avoid at all cost.<br>
Do not panic and bid 2NT when you have a minimum hand.<br>
A 2NT rebid is invitational and shows 16-18 points, just the same as in standard bidding. 
<br><br>

<b>RESPONDER'S SECOND BID WITH 6-10 POINTS</b>
<br><br>

Remember: Responder's 1NT response was forcing on Opener. But, if Opener's second bid is a minimum response Responder 
is permitted to pass.
In general, if Responder is in the 6-10 range, he will bid just as he would have in Standard bidding.
<br><br>

If Opener makes a minimum bid, either rebidding his Major suit, or bidding a new lower-ranking suit then 
Responder has several options.
<br><br>

of a game contract. Here are some possibilities:

Responder is not forced to make a second bid, but with 12 points he should do so.
<br><br>
A bid of 2NT describes the hand very well and allows Opener to bid 3NT, an easy game contract.

With 11 points in support of &spades;s, Responder might have made an immediate limit raise.
<br><br>
However, by first responding 1NT Forcing, then jumping in &spades;s, he describes a limit-raise 
strength hand with only 3-card trump support. An immediate limit-raise is used with 11-12 points 
and 4-card support.

Responder must be cautious about supporting Opener's second suit when it is a minor, since very often

<b>WHEN A 1NT RESPONSE IS NOT FORCING</b>
<br><br>

<b>• When the Opening bid is 1&clubs; or 1<span class="red">&diams;</span>.</b>
<br><br>

After an opening bid of 1&clubs;, a 1NT response is not forcing.<br> 
It shows 6-10 points and no 4-card Major, just as it has always done.<br>
This does not create a problem because there is no 2/1 sequence after a 1&clubs; opening bid so 
you don't need the expanded 1NT response range.
<br><br>

After an opening bid of 1<span class="red">&diams;</span>, a 1NT response is also played as non-forcing, 
showing 6-10 points and no 4-card Major suit. This agreement does have a problem. 
How will you respond holding 11-12 points and a &clubs; suit? You cannot say 2&clubs; since that would 
be 2/1 Game Force, and you are too strong to respond 1NT.
<br><br>

A good method to handle many of these hands is to use a jump to 2NT to show 11-12 points and reasonably balanced. 
Then, you can use a jump to 3NT to show 13-15 points and balanced. Many partnerships give a 2NT response 
to a Major Suit opening some other meaning, (Jacoby 2NT for example), so this agreement only applies after 
a Minor Suit opening bid. 
<br><br>

<b>• When Responder is a passed hand.</b>
<br><br>
There is no need for a Forcing 1NT response when Responder has already passed since in that 
case 2/1 Game Force would not apply and Responder could bid a normal 2-of-a-suit with an 11-12 point hand, and 1NT 
with a 6-10 point hand. In any case, some pairs will be using Reverse Drury or some other convention after 
a third-seat, (possibly light), Opening bid.
<br><br>

<b>• When the Opening bid is followed by an immediate Overcall or Double</b>
<br><br>

If the Opening bid is followed by immediate enemy interference, both 2/1 and Forcing 1NT Response are OFF.<br>
All bidding becomes "Standard" bidding, with the 1NT response showing stopper(s) in the Overcalled suit, and 
2-of-a-suit showing 11 or more points.
<br><br><br>

<b>FORCING 1NT SUMMARY</b>
<br><br>

If partner opens 1&spades; or 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> in first or second seat, a 1NT response 
shows 6-12 points (and no &spades; suit if the opening bid was 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span>).
The bid is forcing on Opener for 1 round.
<br><br>

Opener usually rebids the same as in standard bidding, EXCEPT when he holds a balanced 13-14 point hand which 
he would pass in standard bidding. In this case he bids his longer minor suit (&clubs;s with equal length in the minors).
<br><br>

Responder may pass Opener's minimum rebid, and with 6-10 points should usually do so.<br>
With 11-12 points Responder should strive to find a game-invitation bid.
<br><br>

Forcing 1NT does not apply after a 1&clubs; or 1<span class="red">&diams;</span> opening bid.<br>
Forcing 1NT is OFF if Responder is a passed hand.<br>
Forcing 1NT is OFF if Responder's RHO Overcalls or makes a Takeout Double.
