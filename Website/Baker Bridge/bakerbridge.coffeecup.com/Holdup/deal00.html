<h3>THE HOLD-UP</h3>
<br>

<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>
You may be either Opener or Responder, but you will always be in the South position.
<br><br>
The first page of each Deal shows your hand, dummy's hand, the bidding, the opening lead and early play. 
You are asked to study the Deal and mentally devise a Plan to make the contract. When you have your Plan 
in your mind click <font style="color:#000099">&nbsp;<b>NEXT</b>&nbsp;</font>.
<br><br>
The subsequent page will then appear telling you what you should have done and perhaps giving you a chance
to continue with the Plan by again clicking <font style="color:#000099">&nbsp;<b>NEXT</b>&nbsp;</font>.
<br><br>
On the final page of each Deal all four hands will be shown.
<br><br>

<b>HOLD-UP LESSON</b>
<br><br>

The hold-up play is one of the first techniques bridge players learn, right up there with finessing. And the first 
example they are shown will be something like this one.
<br><br>

You are playing a notrump contract.<br>
Your Left Hand Opponent leads the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>5 and RHO puts on the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q.<br>
Here is the <span class="red">&hearts;</span> suit in dummy's and your hands.
<br><br>
Dummy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 8 4<br><br>
You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A 10 2
<br><br>

Suppose you take your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A at the first (or second) trick. Then, whenever you lose a trick 
to either opponent they will win some <span class="red">&hearts;</span> tricks, four of them if LHO has led a 5-card suit.
<br><br>

But suppose you refuse to win your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A until the third round; you hold-up. Then, whenever you 
lose a trick to your RHO he may be void in <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s because he started out with just three of them. Since 
he cannot lead a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> back to his partner your contract may be successful. 
<br><br>
 
Of course, even after the hold-up, if you lose a later trick to your LHO he will then cash his <span class="red">&hearts;</span> tricks. 
So hold-up plays aren't always perfect solutions.
<br><br>

<b>The Basic Hold-up:</b>
<br><br>

Look at that <span class="red">&hearts;</span> suit in a full example.
<br><br>

The contract is 3NT and West's opening lead is the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>5. 
East plays <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q.
<br><br>

    	<span class="red">&diams;</span> K J 10 9 8<br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; = 2 : <span class="red">&hearts;</span> = 1 : <span class="red">&diams;</span> = 0 
		: &clubs; = 2 : Total = 5. 
		<br><br>
		You need 4 more winners, and Dummy's <span class="red">&diams;</span> suit will provide them. <br>
		The danger is that West may hold five <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s, so when you drive out the 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span>A, the defense may be able to 
		win 4 <span class="red">&hearts;</span> tricks to go along with their 1 <span class="red">&diams;</span>.<br>
		So you hold-up your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A until the third round. Then you 
		play <span class="red">&diams;</span>K and continue with the <span class="red">&diams;</span> suit until the defense takes 
		the <span class="red">&diams;</span>A. If it is East who wins, and he started with only 3 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s, he will 
		have none to return to his partner's hand. And if East does happen to have a fourth <span class="red">&hearts;</span> it 
		means the <span class="red">&hearts;</span> suit was originally 4-4 and you will only lose 3 tricks in the suit..

<b>Holding Up with A J x: or not:</b>
<br><br>

When your LHO leads a suit in which you hold A J x and RHO plays a high honor, you have an interesting situation. This holding 
might be just one stopper, but might be two, depending on which defender will be getting the lead.
<br><br>

The contract is 3NT and West's opening lead is the &spades;6.<br>

<b>Holding Up with Two Stoppers:</b>

<b>Holding Up at a Suit Contract:</b>
<br><br>

The hold-up is utilized most often when you are playing notrump; the purpose usually being to disrupt 
communications between the defenders by exhausting one defender of his partner's suit. This use of 
a hold-up doesn't really apply to suit contracts.
<br><br>

There are other reasons for a hold-up, though, which do apply in suit contracts.
<br><br>

The contract is 4<span class="red">&hearts;</span> and West's opening lead is the &spades;3.<br>
East plays the &spades;Q.
<br><br>

<table>

	<td style="width:3em">&nbsp;</td>

		<br><br>
		&spades; = 1 : <span class="red">&hearts;</span> = 0 : <span class="red">&diams;</span> = 2 
		: &clubs; = 1 : Total = 4. 
		<br><br>
		You can't avoid losing 1 &spades;, and the <span class="red">&diams;</span>A is also a sure loser. 
		If the &clubs; finesse works you would be home free, but even if it fails you can 
		guarantee the contract with a hold-up play.
		<br><br>
		The danger is that if East holds the <span class="red">&diams;</span>A, West may obtain the lead and play a <span class="red">&diams;</span> 
		through dummy's <span class="red">&diams;</span>K, giving you two <span class="red">&diams;</span> losers. You can prevent that from 
		happening if you can prevent West from getting the lead. Since the only suit West can get the lead with is &spades;s, 
		all you have to do is let East win the &spades;Q and take your &spades;A on the second round.
		<br><br>
		Since East cannot attack <span class="red">&diams;</span>s from his side he will have to give you the lead. You pull trumps, 
		then finesse the &clubs;. Even if the finesse loses East cannot play <span class="red">&diams;</span>s without 
		setting up dummy's <span class="red">&diams;</span>K, so you will eventually get to discard one of your <span class="red">&diams;</span> losers
