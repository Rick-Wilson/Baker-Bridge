		Back to the Plan. Having ruffed the <span class="red">&hearts;</span> you are down to just 4 trumps in your hand. You play 
		&spades;A, &spades;K, &spades;Q, noting that East discards on the second round. 
		Therefore West will get a trump trick.
		<br><br>
		But don't give it to him now! Leave West with his master trump and switch to &clubs;s. If West 
		doesn't ruff at all you will run 4 &clubs; tricks and discard your <span class="red">&diams;</span> loser. 
		If he does decide to ruff it will be with a trick you were going to lose anyway. You win his return, ruffing 
		a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> with the last trump, and continue playing &clubs; and <span class="red">&diams;</span> 
		winners.
