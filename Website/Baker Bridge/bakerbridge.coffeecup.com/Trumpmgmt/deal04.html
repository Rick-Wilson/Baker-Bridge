		Bridge is a game of timing, and sometimes the tempo of the game is set by the opening lead.
		<br><br>
		Suppose West's opening lead was a &spades;, a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> or a <span class="red">&diams;</span>. 
		You would have still had the same 3 losers, but now the &clubs; loser would have been 
		"very slow". So slow that you could start on trumps before working on the &spades;s.
		<br><br>
		In other words, with one of these opening leads a mediocre player, one who had never read this lesson, 
		would probably make the contract without any trouble. But with the &clubs; lead only a skilled 
		declarer would make it!
