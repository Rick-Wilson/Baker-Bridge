<h3>TRUMP MANAGEMENT</h3>
<br>

<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>
You may be either Opener or Responder, but you will always be in the South position.
<br><br>
The first page of each Deal shows your hand, dummy's hand, the bidding, the opening lead and early play. 
You are asked to study the Deal and mentally devise a Plan to make the contract. When you have your Plan 
in your mind click <font style="color:#000099"><b>NEXT</b></font>.
<br><br>
The subsequent page will then appear telling you what you should have done and perhaps giving you a chance
to continue with the Plan by again clicking <font style="color:#000099"><b>NEXT</b></font>.
<br><br>
On the final page of each Deal all four hands will be shown.
</p>
<br>

<b>TRUMP MANAGEMENT LESSON</b>
<br><br>
When you play a suit contract the first, and usually most important, decision you need to make is whether to 
start by pulling trumps. Fortunately there is a rule for you to follow which is never wrong.
<br><br>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
<tr><td align="center">&nbsp;YOU SHOULD ALWAYS PULL TRUMPS IMMEDIATELY -&nbsp;<br>EXCEPT FOR THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU SHOULDN'T</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
This lesson and the Deals that go with it will show you those times.
<br><br>

<b>Always pull trumps immediately:</b>
<br><br>
 
The contract is 4<span class="red">&hearts;</span> and West leads the &spades;J.

		<br><br>
		You are ecstatic that West didn't lead a minor suit so you play your 3 high &spades;s and discard 
		a <span class="red">&diams;</span> from dummy on the third one. Unfortunately East ruffs the &spades; and 
		the defense takes their <b>2</b> <span class="red">&diams;</span> tricks plus the &clubs;A.
		<br><br>
		This is a really basic example but I'll bet we have all seen it happen. Of course you should win the first 
		trick, <b>THEN PULL TRUMPS</b>, then run the &spades;s for the discard.

Too easy you say, and you are right. Probably everybody reading this would have pulled trumps.
<br><br>

Have you ever had someone, (your partner?), tell you that they couldn't pull trumps because the suit 
was too weak? Bad reasoning; with weak trumps and strong side suits you should lead trumps early and often. 
<br><br>

The contract is 4&spades; and West leads the &clubs;8.
<br><br>
<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:3em">&nbsp;</td>

    	&clubs; K J 9
    </td>
 	<td style="width:3em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
		You have no losers in any suit except trumps.
		<br><br>
		And if the trumps split 3-2 you can HOPE to lose only 3 tricks there. So you should win the first trick 
		and lead a trump - which you will lose. Win the next trick and play another trump - which you will lose. 
		Win the next trick and lose one more trump if you like, it doesn't matter at this point.
		<br><br>
		But think what could happen if you didn't play on trumps at every opportunity. You could be leading high 
		side suit cards and East ruffs a &clubs; with the &spades;10. Then West ruffs 
		a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> with the &spades;J. And East ruffs with the &spades;Q, and 
		West ruffs with the &spades;K and somebody still has the &spades;A. In other words 
		the defenders had 5 high trumps and you let them make them all individually.

<b>Always pull trumps immediately: except when . . .</b><br>

		You can win your 4 side suit high cards, then alternate ruffing 4 &spades;s in dummy

		<br><br>
		One of the two keys to a cross-ruff is that you might not have enough winners if you play a round of trumps. 
		In this deal, for example, you needed to make all 8 trumps individually; even one lead would have cost 
		you two trumps for one winning trick.
		<br><br>
		The second key is that you must take any side-suit winners early. Here if you delay taking your &clubs;A 
		and &clubs;K, one of the defenders might discard &clubs;s while you are playing the other 
		suits and be able to ruff a &clubs; winner late in the game.

<b>Always pull trumps immediately: except when . . .</b><br>
<b>. . . you plan a dummy reversal:</b>
<br><br>

A mistake made frequently by beginners is taking an early ruff in the long-trump hand. When you ruff in the short-trump 
hand it does two good things - it gives you an immediate winner and it also gives you an extra winner. When you 
ruff in the long-trump hand it gives you an immediate winner but it seldom gives you an extra trick.
<br><br>

Look at these three hands:
<br><br>

You are playing a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> contract and West leads the &clubs; A K.

<b>The last word:</b>
<br><br>

This lesson and the practice Deals are mainly about the various times when you need to delay pulling 
trumps or perhaps not pull them at all. Don't let that give you the wrong idea though.
