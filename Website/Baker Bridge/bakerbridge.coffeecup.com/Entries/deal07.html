		<br><br>
		Sure you can, by creating an entry in &clubs;s. It is likely from the opening lead, 
		(and East's play of a small card), that West has led from &clubs; Q 10 7 5. If you win the 
		first trick cheaply then you will still make your &clubs; A K for three &clubs; tricks 
		in all.
		<br><br>
		So don't win cheaply, win the first trick with the &clubs;A. Then unblock your <span class="red">&diams;</span> A J. 
		Next play &clubs;K. (on which East discards), and a small &clubs; toward dummy's 
		&clubs; J 9. You are sure to have a &clubs; entry to dummy's <span class="red">&diams;</span>s, 
		and you will still get three &clubs; tricks, just a different three.
