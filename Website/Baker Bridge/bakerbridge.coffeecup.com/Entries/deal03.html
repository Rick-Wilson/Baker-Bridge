		<br><br>
		Not quite, there is one more hurdle to hurdle. You must put all thought of a <span class="red">&diams;</span> finesse 
		far out of your mind. Play <span class="red">&diams;</span>A, then <span class="red">&diams;</span>10, overtaking with <span class="red">&diams;</span>J and 
		continuing the suit until the King appears. Now you should be able to come to 9 tricks unless there is a very unfortunate 
		distribution which lets the defenders score 3 <span class="red">&hearts;</span> tricks along with their 1 &clubs; and 
		1 <span class="red">&diams;</span>.
