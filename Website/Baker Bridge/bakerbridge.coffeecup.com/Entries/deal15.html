		<br><br>
		If East has just &clubs; K x then one finesse, followed by the &clubs;A to drop 
		the &clubs;K and a small &clubs; back to dummy will give you the 4 &clubs; 
		winners you must have. But if East has &clubs; K x x and refuses to cover then you will be able 
		to establish the &clubs;s but will need an extra dummy entry to enjoy that last winner.
		<br><br>
		So win the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K and play the <span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q. If both defenders follow suit you 
		can afford to overtake your <span class="red">&diams;</span>J with dummy's <span class="red">&diams;</span>A. Now play the &clubs;10 
		and let it ride. If it holds the trick play another &clubs; to your &clubs;J and then 
		play the &clubs;A, dropping East's &clubs;K.
		<br><br>
		Enter dummy by playing your <span class="red">&diams;</span>3 to the <span class="red">&diams;</span>6 and take your established 
		&clubs; for the ninth trick.
