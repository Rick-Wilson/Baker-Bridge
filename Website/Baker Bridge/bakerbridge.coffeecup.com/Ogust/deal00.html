<h3>OGUST CONVENTION</h3>

<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>

You will always be in the South position. Either you or partner may open the bidding.
<br><br>

The first page (or two) of each Deal shows only your hand. The initial bidding is given and you are asked to decide 
what you would bid, then click the word <font style="color:#000099"><b>BID</b></font> up in the bidding table. 
The next page will then appear showing the recommended bid and continuing the auction. 
On the final page of each Deal partner's hand will be shown.
<br><br>

<b>ABOUT OGUST</b>
<br><br>

First let's review the "standard" bidding which follows a Weak 2-bid opening.  
<br><br>

If the Responder has an interest in going higher he bids 2NT.<br>
The Weak-2 opener replies as follows:
<ul>
  <li>With a minimum, rebid the suit at the 3-level</li>
  <li>With a maximum, show a feature (Ace or King) of an outside suit by bidding that suit at the 3-level</li>
  <li>With a solid suit (A K Q x x x) bid 3NT</li>
</ul>

If you are happy with that method just stop reading this and go over to the Weak 2-bid topic for some practice!
<br><br>

<b>Ogust rebids:</b>
<br><br>

As the popularity of Weak 2-bids has increased, the requirement for suit quality has declined. Many 
of today's players ignore the old requirement that you should have 2 of the top 3 honors, 
(or 3 honors altogether) in the suit.
<br><br>

A hand like
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> Q 9 8 6 5 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> A 7 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 9 6 2
<br>
might be opened 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> by an opponent.<br>
Or, you might fall under the spell and open 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> with the hand yourself.
<br><br>

Harold Ogust developed a convention to allow Responder to obtain more information from the Weak-2 opener. 
The Ogust Convention also starts with Responder bidding 2NT, but Opener's rebids are more descriptive.
<br><br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
<tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;<b>OPENER REBIDS AFTER OGUST 2NT</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">&nbsp;3&clubs;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;minimum hand&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;poor suit&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">&nbsp;3<span class="red">&diams;</span>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;minimum hand&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;good suit&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">&nbsp;3<span class="red">&hearts;</span>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;maximum hand&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;poor suit&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">&nbsp;3&spades;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;maximum hand&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;good suit&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">&nbsp;3NT&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2">&nbsp;A K Q x x x suit&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

In theory, once the Responder learns which of the five categories Opener falls into he should be able to 
set the contract correctly.
<br><br>

Of course it is important that the partners are agreed on the meanings of minimum/maximum and poor/good.<br>
Here are our suggestions:
<br><br>

Assuming your Weak 2-bid strength is 6-11 total points, use 6-8 as minimum, 9-11 as maximum.
<br><br>

A good suit is headed by any two of the top three honors ( A K Q ) a poor suit is not.
<br><br><br>

That's all there is to it. The 10 Practice Deals are worth 10,000 more words.
