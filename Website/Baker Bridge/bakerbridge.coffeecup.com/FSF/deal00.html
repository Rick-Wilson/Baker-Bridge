<h3>FOURTH SUIT FORCING</h3>
<br>

<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>
You may be either Opener or Responder, but you will always be in the South position.
<br><br>
The first few pages of each Deal show only your hand. The initial bidding (if any) is given and you are asked 
to decide what you would bid, then click <font style="color:#000099"><b>BID</b></font>. 
The next page will then appear telling you what you should have bid and continuing the auction. 
On the final page of each Deal partner's hand will be shown.
<br><br>
Although it is not a part of the Deals you might wish to examine your and dummy's hand and make a Plan 
of how you would play the contract.
<br><br><br>

<b>FOURTH SUIT FORCING SUMMARY</b>
<br><br>
This is a bad name for a good convention. It's bad because probably every Bridge player in the world 
plays that a bid of the fourth suit by their partner is already forcing. As a matter of history, the 
convention was originally called "Fourth Suit Artificial", but the name didn't stick. So we will 
call it Fourth Suit Forcing (FSF) but in reality it is FOURTH SUIT FORCING AND ARTIFICIAL.
<br><br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
	<tr><td align="center">
	A bid by Responder, at his second turn, of the fourth suit is<br>
	artificial and is made when no other reasonable bid is available.<br>
	It is forcing and Opener is asked to further describe his hand.</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

While everybody plays the bid as forcing, there is not a universal agreement of what it is forcing to! 
Many partnerships play the bid as forcing to game, many others play it as forcing for one round, but 
merely invitational to game. Of course you will do as you like, but for the purposes of these practice 
Deals we will play it as a one-round-force which is invitational to game, about 12 points or more.
<br><br>

In many ways FSF is similar to the New Minor Forcing convention, and we suggest that you play the two 
conventions with the same forcing principle, just for consistency.
<br><br>

<table>
<tr><td align="center" width="50"><b>Pard</b></td><td align="center" width="50"><b>You</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1&clubs;</td><td align="center">1<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1&spades;</td><td align="center">2<span class="red">&diams;</span></td></tr>
</table>
<br>

Your 2<span class="red">&diams;</span> bid is forcing and definitely does not show a <span class="red">&diams;</span> suit. 
After your side has bid three suits the chances of finding an 8-card fit in the fourth suit is 
practically zero. If you really had a <span class="red">&diams;</span> suit you would surely just bid notrump 
at your second turn.<br>
So this is FSF and your hand might be:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; Q 9 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A K J 7 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> 10 7 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; A 2
<br><br>

You cannot support either of partner's suits, you cannot rebid your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s, and 
you cannot bid notrump with no <span class="red">&diams;</span> stopper. But you have 15 points and partner 
has opened, so you have to find some bid! Aha! Bid FSF and await partner's next bid.
<br><br><br>

<b>Requirements for FSF:</b>

As we have said, Responder needs a minimum of 12 points; a hand that is at least invitational. 
More often than not Responder will have enough strength to insist on game, but not know 
which game to bid. There are two types of hand that benefit most from FSF.
<br><br>
 
When Responder has a notrump type hand but doesn't have a stopper in the fourth suit he can use FSF.

<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<b>Pard</b>&nbsp;</td><td><b>&nbsp;You</b>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1<span class="red">&diams;</span></td><td align="center">1&spades;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">2&clubs;</td><td align="center">??</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; K Q J 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 10 8 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> K 7
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; A J 9 6
<br><br>

With 14 points you know you want to reach game. You could just bid 3NT and hope partner has a 
<span class="red">&hearts;</span> stopper but that might turn out very embarassing. You can't bid 3&clubs; 
because partner would probably pass. And if you jump to 4&clubs; you have bypassed 3NT, which 
might well be your best game. So you bid 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> and force partner to bid again.
<br><br>

When Responder's first suit is a 5-card Major he can use FSF to get partner show 3-card support.

<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<b>Pard</b>&nbsp;</td><td><b>&nbsp;You</b>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1&clubs;</td><td align="center">1<span class="red">&hearts;</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1&spades;</td><td align="center">??</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; K 6 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A K 10 8 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> 8 7
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; K 10 6
<br><br>

With 14 points you know you want to reach game. You cannot support either of partner's suits, you  
can't rebid a 5-card <span class="red">&hearts;</span> suit, and you certainly can't bid notrump. So you bid 
2<span class="red">&diams;</span> (FSF) and see what partner has to say. If he has 3 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s 
he will return to that suit and you can bid the game. Or, he might bid notrump himself. 
<br><br>

Besides these two main purposes you can use FSF whenever you want to make a forcing bid but don't 
like your other choices.
<br><br><br>

<b>Opener's rebid after FSF:</b>
<br><br>

Here are Opener's recommended rebids, listed in order of priority:
<ol>
  <li>Rebid his own second suit if 5-5 or better.</li>
  <li>Support partner's first suit with 3 cards.</li>
  <li>Bid 2NT with a stopper in the fourth suit and a minimum.</li>
  <li>Bid 3NT with a stopper in the fourth suit and a maximum.</li>
  <li>Raise the fourth suit with 4-cards, but don't bypass 3NT (rare).</li>
  <li>Rebid a 5-card suit if no other bid can be made.</li>
</ol>

<b>Odds and ends:</b>
<br><br>

<i>If either partner is a passed hand, FSF does not apply.</i>
<br><br>

<i>If the opponents interfere you should play that FSF is off.</i>
<br><br>

<i>There is one special case where a bid of the fourth suit is not FSF.</i>
