		<br><br>
		You can now ruff all 3 of those &spades; losers in the South hand. Like this:<br>
		Win the &spades;A and ruff a &spades; with the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A.<br>
		Play a small <span class="red">&hearts;</span> to dummy's <span class="red">&hearts;</span>9.<br>
		Ruff another &spades; with the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K.<br>
		Play a small <span class="red">&hearts;</span> to dummy's <span class="red">&hearts;</span>10.<br>
		Ruff dummy's last &spades; with your last trump, the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>J.<br>
		Enter dummy with a <span class="red">&diams;</span> and pull the last trump with the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q.
		<br><br>
		You win 3 <span class="red">&diams;</span>s, 3 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s in dummy, the &spades;A
