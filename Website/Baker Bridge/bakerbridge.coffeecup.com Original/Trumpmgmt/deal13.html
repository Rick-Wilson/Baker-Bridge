		You ruff of course, that was the whole point of playing <span class="red">&diams;</span>s before trumps. But which card

		<span class="red">&diams;</span>. You could then play &spades;A and ruff a &spades; to 
		get to your hand, then ruff your last <span class="red">&diams;</span> with dummy's <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A. You would 
		lose only the trump King and one &clubs;, making an overtrick.
		<br><br>
		Any problem with that? Yes, a big problem. East might be out of <span class="red">&diams;</span>s also. If you 
		ruff with dummy's <span class="red">&hearts;</span>5 East may overruff, then play a trump and you would not get 
		any <span class="red">&diams;</span> ruffs. Since you only need to ruff one <span class="red">&diams;</span> in dummy 
		to make the contract, it is safer to ruff with the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A. You will end up losing 
		1 &clubs;, 1<span class="red">&diams;</span> and the trump King.
