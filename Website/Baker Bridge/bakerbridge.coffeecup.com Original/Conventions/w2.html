		Whether a Weak 2-Bid should be called a Convention or a natural bid is a matter of taste. 
		Here it is considered a Convention because it is more structured than preemptive 3 and 4 bids.
		<br><br>
		
		You can open with a Weak 2-Bid whenever your hand matches this:
		<ul>
		<li>A 6-card suit with some decent strength, maybe 2 or 3 honors</li>
		<li>6-11 points, including the 2 points for the fifth and sixth card</li>
		<li>no outside 4-card Major suit</li>
		</ul>
		The suit must be &spades;s, <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s 
		or <span class="red">&diams;</span>s. You cannot open with a Weak 2-Bid in &clubs;s because that bid 
		is reserved for very strong hands. The purpose of the Weak 2-Bid is primarily obstructive, 
		just as with the other Preemptive bids. However, since the bid is so descriptive the Responder will 
		have a pretty easy time with later bids.
		<br><br>
		There are two different philosophies in responding to a Weak 2-Bid.<br>
		One is called RONF for 'Raise is the Only Non Forcing' bid. Basically this means that when the 
		initial Response is either a new suit or Notrump Opener is required to bid again.<br>
		The second doesn't have a name, but it says that 2NT is the only forcing bid.
		<br><br>
		
		The two methods are different only in how they treat a new suit bid by Responder; Forcing or Non-Forcing. 
		For this topic the second method, 2NT being the only Forcing bid will be used.
		<br><br>
		
		Responder needs about 15 or more points to be considering game. With fewer points than that 
		he has two choices.
		<ul>
		<li>Raise Opener's suit. This is just increasing the obstruction value.</li>
		<li>Bidding his own suit. This is done only if Responder believes his suit is better.</li>
		</ul>
		
		With a stronger hand Responder usually bids 2NT, forcing Opener to further describe his hand 
		according to the following:
		<ul>
		<li>6-8 points : return to 3 of the suit</li>
		<li>9-11 points : bid a suit with a 'feature' (an Ace or a King, perhaps a Queen)</li>
		<li>A K Q x x x suit : bid 3NT</li>
		</ul>
		Responder should be in a position to finalize the contract after this bidding sequence.
		<br><br>
