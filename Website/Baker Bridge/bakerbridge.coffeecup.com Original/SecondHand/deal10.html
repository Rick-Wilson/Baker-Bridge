		Play the &clubs;J.
		<br><br>
		You should not allow yourself to be misled by South winning the first trick with the 
		&spades;Q. East does not hold either the &spades;A or the &spades;J or he would have played it. 
		South is just trying to be deceptive.
		<br><br>
		That means you need the next &spades; play to come from East, so you play your &clubs;J and let East win 
		his &clubs;A. You can be sure East has the &clubs;A because South would have played the suit differently 
		if he held the Ace.
		<br><br>
		East will win the &clubs;A and return his &spades; through South's &spades; A Q.<br>
		This allows you to set up your &spades; suit while you still have the &clubs;K for an entry.
