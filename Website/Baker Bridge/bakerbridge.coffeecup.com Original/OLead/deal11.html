		Lead the &spades;7, the suit your partner overcalled.
		<br><br>
		If partner had not overcalled, the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q would be the perfect lead against 3NT.<br>
		But partner DID overcall, perhaps to give you a hint on what to lead if South became declarer.
		<br><br>
		As you see, a &spades; lead will defeat the contract this time while the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q 
		would let declarer make 11 tricks.
		<br><br>
		Consider this: even if partner has a high <span class="red">&hearts;</span> to help you establish the 
		suit it is not very likely that you would be able to get the lead with your entryless hand.
		<br><br>
		There is another, more subtle, reason for leading partner's suit.<br>
		If the lead turns out wrong, and the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q lead would have beaten the 
		conract, partner will not blame you in the least.<br>
		But if you lead the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q and it turns out that a &spades; lead would have 
		let you set the contract, well, that would not be too good for partnership harmony.
