		Play the &clubs;6.
		<br><br>
		On first thought East's &clubs;2 seems to be a discouraging signal.<br>
		Think again.
		<br><br>
		After the first trick you know the location of every &clubs; except the &clubs;Q and &clubs;J.<br>
		If East started with &clubs; J 2 he would have signaled with the &clubs;J.<br>
		If East started with &clubs; Q J 2 he would have signaled with the &clubs;Q.<br>
		Since he did neither he started either with singleton &clubs; 2 or with &clubs; Q 2.<br>
		In either case you should play a low &clubs; now which he will either win with his &clubs;Q 
		or he will ruff.
		<br><br>
		It turns out that he wins with the &clubs;Q, then leads a &spades; back to your &spades; A Q.
