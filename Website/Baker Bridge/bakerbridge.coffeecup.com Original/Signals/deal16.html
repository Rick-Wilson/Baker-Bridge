		Play the &clubs;9.
		<br><br>
		West will look at your &clubs;9 and perhaps think for an instant that you want him 
		to play another &clubs;.
		<br><br>
		But it will be a short instant because a look at dummy makes in absolutely clear to 
		everybody that playing another &clubs; could not help your side. Dummy has so many trumps that 
		repeated &clubs; leads would do nothing.
		<br><br>
		OK. If it's not an encouraging Attitude signal, what is it?<br>
		Suit preference of course. Since it is a high spot card you are asking West to switch to the 
		higher suit (choosing between <span class="red">&diams;</span>s and <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s).
		<br><br>
		West dutifully plays a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> and you take the next three tricks.<br>
		Had he switched to a <span class="red">&diams;</span> instead, South would have been able to discard one of his <span class="red">&hearts;</span> losers 
		on North's <span class="red">&diams;</span>Q.
