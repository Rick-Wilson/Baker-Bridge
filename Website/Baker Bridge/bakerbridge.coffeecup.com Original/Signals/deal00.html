<h3>DEFENSIVE SIGNALS</h3>

<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>

South will always be declarer and you may be either West or East.
<br><br>

Feel free to disagree with the bidding which is more or less Standard American, not 2-Over-1.
<br><br>

The first page of each Deal shows your hand, dummy's hand, the opening lead, the bidding 
and any other pertinent facts.<br> 
You are asked to study the information available and decide what you would play.<br>
When you have decided click<font style="color:#000099">&nbsp;<b>NEXT</b></font>.
<br><br>

The next page shows all four hands.
<br><br><br>

<b>DEFENSIVE SIGNALS LESSON</b>
<br><br>

You keep reading about Defense being much more difficult than Declarer play. It is true.<br>
The main reason for this is that Declarer and dummy are always in sync because it is 
only one person calling all the shots and making all the decisions. Declarer can see his 
own thirteen cards plus dummy's thirteen; this makes his job easier to do.
<br><br>
On defense there are two of you, neither one knowing what cards the other one holds, or 
what plans he may be making. Each defender can see his own thirteen cards and dummy's 
thirteen cards but not his partner's; this makes his job harder to do. 
<br><br>

To help make up for this disadvantage, defenders must utilize signals to describe certain features of 
their hands, such as high-card locations and distribution.
<br><br>

The ensuing sections describe some of the available signaling techniques.
<br><br><br>

<b>Attitude Signals</b>
<br><br>

Attitude may seem a peculiar word to use to name a type of signal, but all it means is 
whether you like the card led by your partner or not. It works like this.
<br><br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
 <tr><td>ATTITUDE SIGNALS<br><br>
 When partner leads to a trick and you want to encourage him<br>
 to play that suit again you play a high spot card.<br><br>
 If you want to discourage him from playing that suit <br>
 you play a low spot card.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

It is a pretty simple idea, one which has been in use for many years.<br>
Here's how it works.
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">
   		&spades; 8 5 3
    </td>
 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
		Defending against a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> contract your partner, West, leads the &spades;A.<br>
		You expect him to also have the &spades;K since it is usually unwise to lead an 
		unsupported Ace.
		<br><br>
		You play the &spades;9, a higher than normal spot card and an <b><i>encouraging</i></b> attitude signal.<br>
		He continues with &spades;K and a third &spades; and your side takes three tricks in the suit.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 	<td>
   		&spades; A K 10 4
 		</td>
    <td align="left"><img src="../tvs.gif"/></td>
    <td>
 		&spades; Q 9 2
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td valign="top">
   		&spades; J 7 6
    </td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

Contrast that situation with this:
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">

 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
		Defending against a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> contract your partner, West, leads the &spades;A.<br>
		You expect him to also have the &spades;K since it is usually unwise to lead an 
		unsupported Ace.
		<br><br>
		You play the &spades;2, a low spot card and an <b><i>discouraging</i></b> attitude signal.<br>
		Knowing you don't want him to continue the suit he will switch.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 	<td>
   		&spades; A K 10 4
 		</td>
    <td align="left"><img src="../tvs.gif"/></td>
    <td>
 		&spades; J 9 2
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td valign="top">
   		&spades; Q 7 6
    </td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

Sometimes you may want to encourage, but not have a very high spot card to play.<br>
Partner will need to stay observant.
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">

    </td>
 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
		Defending against a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> contract your partner, West, leads the &spades;A.<br>
		You want to encourage, but don't have any high cards in the suit.
		<br><br>
		You play the &spades;3, hoping partner will notice that the &spades;2 is missing and<br>
		consider that you started with &spades; Q 3 2.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 	<td>
   		&spades; A K 10 4
 		</td>
    <td align="left"><img src="../tvs.gif"/></td>
    <td>

	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td valign="top">
   		&spades; J 7 6
    </td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

The flip side is when you want to discourage, but have no low card with which to signal.
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">

 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
		Defending against a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> contract your partner, West, leads the &spades;A.<br>
		You want to discourage, but don't have any low cards in the suit.
		<br><br>
		You play the &spades;6 and hope partner will see enough other low cards to<br>
		realize that might be your lowest &spades;.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 	<td>
   		&spades; A K 10 4
 		</td>
    <td align="left"><img src="../tvs.gif"/></td>

   		&spades; Q 9 2
    </td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

A final point.<br>
Attitude signals are for the purpose of giving information; they are suggestions, not commands.<br>
Your partner might will decide to ignore your suggestion.
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>

		Partner will likely continue the suit anyway by playing the &spades;Q.

<b>Attitude Signal with a Doubleton:</b>
<br><br>

Defending against a suit contract you might have a doubleton in the suit partner leads.<br>

<b>Attitude Signal with a Doubleton Honor:</b>
<br><br>

When you have a doubleton honor you must decide whether to start by playing the honor in order 
to show partner your doubleton, or to save the honor so as not to throw away a trick.<br>
Here is a simple guideline which gives good results.
<br><br>

<b>The Special Case of Q J:</b>
<br><br>

When you hold Q J of a suit, (or Q J x, or Q J x x), and partner leads a low card in the suit you 
would generally play the Jack, the lower of touching honors.
<br><br>

But partner leads the Ace of the suit instead you have the opportunity to use a special signal.

Just remember that this signal is only used when defending against a suit contract.<br>
When defending a Notrump contract a different procedure is used when partner leads an Ace.
<br><br><br>

<b>Count Signals</b>
<br><br>

Attitude signals are used when your partner has led a card.<br>
It obviously makes no sense to give an Attitud signal if Declarer or dummy leads a card since Declarer 
won't pay any attention to you anyway.
<br><br>

The way you can help your defense the most when Declarer plays a card is to give a Count Signal.
<br><br>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
 <tr><td>
 When Declarer (or dummy) plays a suit for the first time the card you<br>
 play should indicate the number of cards you hold in the suit.
 <br><br>
 If you hold an odd number of cards play a low spot card, <br>
 for an even number play a high spot card.
 </td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

This can be useful to partner almost any time, but it is extra important when dummy has a 
long suit and no other entries.

<b>Suit Preference Signals:</b>

A third type of signal used by Defenders is the Suit Preference Signal.<br>

If the situation makes it clear that a player's signal is NOT ATTITUDE, and NOT COUNT, 
then it is Suit Preference.

<b>Suit Preference Signal with Discard</b>
<br><br>

Using your discard to signal your partner about a suit you like is another good 
opportunity for defenders to communicate.
<br><br>

It works like an Attitude signal, a high card encourages, a low card discourages.<br>
Like this:
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">
   		&spades; Q 10 5<br>
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span> Q 10 5
    </td>
 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
	You are East, defending against a Notrump contract.<br>
	A &clubs; is led, and you are void in &clubs;s.
	<br><br>
	You should discard your &spades;9, a suit preference signal suggesting partner play &spades;s 
	if he gets into the lead.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 	<td>
   		&spades; 6 4 3<br>
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 6 4 3
 		</td>
    <td align="left"><img src="../tvs.gif"/></td>
    <td>
 		&spades; K J 9 8 2<br>
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 8 7 2
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td valign="top">
   		&spades; A 7<br>
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A K J 9
    </td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

Sometimes you cannot afford to throw the card you would like to use for your signal:
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">
   		&spades; Q 10 5<br>
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span> Q 10 5
    </td>
 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
	You are East, defending against a Notrump contract.<br>
	A &clubs; is led, and you are void in &clubs;s.
	<br><br>
	You should not discard your &spades;9, because it might win a later trick.<br>
	Here, if you throw the &spades;9 South can play the &spades;s to win two tricks in the suit, while 
	if you hold the &spades;9 he can only win one trick.
	<br><br>
	You can usually accomplish the same result by discarding a LOW card in another suit.<br>
	So discard the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>2, and if West gets in the lead he will 
	know you don't want a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> lead and 
	with the looks of dummy will probably pick a &spades;.
