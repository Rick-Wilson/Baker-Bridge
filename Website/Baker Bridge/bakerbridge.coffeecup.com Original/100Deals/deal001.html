		Do not be tempted to say 2<span class="red">&diams;</span>, even with such good 3-card help. To support

		<br><br>
		Instead you bid 1NT showing a balanced 6-10 point hand with no 4-card Major suit. Partner passes.
		<br><br>
		South plays 1NT. West leads the &spades;4. East wins the &spades;A, then plays 
		the &spades;9. West takes his &spades;K and leads another &spades;, East 
		discarding a <span class="red">&hearts;</span>.

		To make a PLAN for a Notrump contract you should count your winners.
		<br><br>
		Winners: &spades; 1 : <span class="red">&hearts;</span> 1 : <span class="red">&diams;</span> 2 : &clubs; 3 : Total = 7
		<br><br>
		For this deal you see that you already have all the winners you need to make the contract. So you just want 
		to be sure you don't do something stupid that would jeopardize those winners.
		<br><br>
		You win the &spades;Q, then lead to the &clubs;A, &clubs;K, &clubs;Q. 
		Everybody follows suit to these three tricks. Next you take the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A. Then you play a 
		small <span class="red">&diams;</span> to your <span class="red">&diams;</span>K, then play your <span class="red">&diams;</span>A. 
		You have now won your required 7 tricks, but you have a bonus. Since all 
		the &clubs;s except the &clubs;8 have been played your &clubs;8 is now high 
		and you make an overtrick.

		This is an example of a straightforward hand where you should take your winners.
		<br><br>
		But even with this type of hand you should make sure you take them in the right order. Here, if 
		you had played the <span class="red">&diams;</span>A and <span class="red">&diams;</span>K <b>BEFORE</b> you played the &clubs; A K Q 
		you would have had no entry back to the fourth &clubs; in your hand. In this case it was only 
		an overtrick, in other deals it could make the difference between making and going down.
