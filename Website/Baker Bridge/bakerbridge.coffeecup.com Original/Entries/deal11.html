		<br><br>
		Well, you probably do. West's small &clubs; lead probably indicates an honor, and with East 
		playing the &clubs;A you can be pretty sure that West holds the &clubs;J. 
		So by playing your &clubs;K underneath the &clubs;A you set up a second entry 
		to dummy via the &clubs; finesse.
		<br><br>
		Assume East now plays a <span class="red">&hearts;</span>. Take your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A and play a &clubs; to 
		dummy's &clubs;10. Lead a <span class="red">&diams;</span> and finesse the <span class="red">&diams;</span>J, which holds. 
		Play another &clubs; to dummy and finesse another <span class="red">&diams;</span>. 
		Now play your <span class="red">&diams;</span>A and smile when the <span class="red">&diams;</span>K drops and your 
		fourth <span class="red">&diams;</span> becomes a winner.
