		Of course it can.<br>

		loses to West's &clubs;K. West plays another &spades;.
		<br><br>
		Now play the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>10, and when West follows you are safe to overtake 
		with dummy's <span class="red">&hearts;</span>J since you can tell that East did not start with 4 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s. 
		In fact, East shows out so it is West who started with 4 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s but that won't be a problem 
		for you. Play another &clubs; from dummy, finessing the &clubs;10 which wins.
		<br><br>
		Now play your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>3 toward dummy, finessing the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>8 when West follows with 
		a low card. Play dummy's two <span class="red">&hearts;</span> winners, discarding <span class="red">&diams;</span>s,  then the 
		low &clubs; to your &clubs;J. Wow.

		The making of a Plan is a very important step in being a good Declarer.
		<br><br>
		And as you have figured by now, assessing how many entries you are going to need is big 
		part of that plan. Like here, if you had won a single <span class="red">&hearts;</span> trick in your hand then 
		you wouldn't have had the three entries to dummy.
