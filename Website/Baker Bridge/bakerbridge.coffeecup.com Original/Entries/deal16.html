		This is another twist on the them of winning with a higher card than necessary.
		<br><br>
		Here it doesn't actually create an extra entry, it just preserves the one entry you have but saves 
		you an actual trick.
		<br><br>
		Here is an interesting point.<br>
		Suppose that West's opening lead had been a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> and East had taken 
		the first four <span class="red">&hearts;</span> tricks then played a <span class="red">&diams;</span>.<br>
		You would have played the hand the same way! Take the &clubs;K, then finesse the &clubs;J.
