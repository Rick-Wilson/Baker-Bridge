<h3>MAJOR SUIT OPENINGS</h3>
<i>Note: This lesson assumes you are <b>NOT</b> playing the 2-over-1 Game Force system.</i><br>
<i>Note: This lesson assumes you are <b>NOT</b> playing Jacoby 2NT for strong Major raises.</i><br>
<i>If you are playing either of these conventions you don't need this lesson.</i>

<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>
You may be either Opener or Responder, but you will always be in the South position.
<br><br>
The first page or two of each Deal shows only your hand. The initial bidding is given and you are asked to decide 
what you would bid, then click <font style="color:#000099">&nbsp;<b>BID</b>&nbsp;</font>. 
The subsequent page will then appear telling you what you should have bid and continuing the auction. 
On the final page of each Deal partner's hand will be shown.
<br><br>
Although it is not included in the Deals you might wish to examine your and dummy's hand and make a Plan 
of how you would play the contract.
<br><br><br>

<b>MAJOR SUIT OPENINGS</b>
<br><br>
<b>Opening bids:</b>
<br><br>
To open 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> or 1&spades; you should have a least 5 cards in the suit. 
Any 5 cards will do, even 6 5 4 3 2.
<br><br>
You should also have between 13 and 21 points. Well, maybe 12 good points will do.
<br><br>
Here are some examples of a 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> opening bid.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; 9 8 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A K Q 9 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> K 7
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 9 7 6
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; A 6 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 9 8 7 5 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> A 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; A 6 5
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; K 7 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A K Q J 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> A Q
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 8 3 2
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> Q J 9 7 4 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> K Q 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; A Q 4
<br><br>
You might have opened hand #3 with 2NT, but probably not.
<br><br>
<b>Responses:</b>
<br><br>
With fewer than three cards in partner's suit use these responses.
<br><br>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
<tr><td align="center"><b>Points</b></td><td><b>Response</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">0-5</td><td>pass</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">6-10</td><td>bid new suit at 1 level or bid 1NT</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">11-16</td><td>bid new suit at 1 or 2 level</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">13-15</td><td>bid 2NT if balanced</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
If you do have at least three cards in partner's Major suit, then you already know of the 8-card fit 
and can be pretty sure you will end up playing in that suit. These responses apply.
<br><br>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
<tr><td align="center"><b>Points</b></td><td><b>Recommended Response</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">0-5</td><td>pass with 3 or 4 card support</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">6-10</td><td>raise partner to 2-level</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">10-12</td><td>limit raise; jump to 3-level</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">13-15</td><td>bid a new suit (forcing) then bid 4 of the Major</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">0-9</td><td>bid game with 5 card support</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
This set of bids isn't universally agreed.<br>
Some don't use the weak jump to game even though it is there primarily for preemptive purposes.<br>
Others switch the third and fourth bids, using a jump to the 3-level as forcing to game and 
a new suit then 3 of the Major as the 11-12 point hand.
<br><br>
We recommend sticking to the table, and have used this system throughout the examples.
<br><br>
<b>Opener Rebids:</b>
<br><br>
Once Responder shows at least 6 points with a response Opener puts his hand into one of three categories:
<br><br>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
<tr><td align="center"><b>Points</b></td><td><b>Category</b></td><td><b>Rebids</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">13-15</td><td>Minimum</td><td>Rebid the Major suit if 6-cards<br>Bid a new lower-ranking suit<br>Bid cheapest notrump</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">16-18</td><td>Medium</td><td>Jump rebid a 6-card Major<br>Bid a new suit<br>Jump in NT or partner's suit</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">19-21</td><td>Maximum</td><td>Jump rebid a 6-card Major<br>Jump shift in a new suit<br>Jump to 3NT or game in partner's suit</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
By now either Opener or Responder may be in a position to place the contract, or another bid may be needed.
<br><br>
<b>Help Suit Game Try:</b>
<br><br>
Suppose you have a hand like this:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; A 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> A K Q 9 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> K 7 6 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 9 3
<br><br>
You open 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> partner responds 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>. 
You have agreed on the trump suit, but now have to figure out how high. 
You have 17/18 points and partner has shown 6-10 so you know the total is between 23 and 28. 
Not strong enough to bid game, but good enough to invite to game.
<br><br>
The "normal" invitational bid you might make is 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span>. This would tell partner 
to check his points and pass if he has 6 or 7, but go to game if he has 9 or 10. With 8 he would have to 
make a judgement call.
<br><br>
A better invitational bid is 3<span class="red">&diams;</span>, a suit you could use "Help" in. This bid in no way changes 
the fact that you are going to end up in <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s since that is already agreed. What it does is 
helps partner if he has a close call. With 9 or 10 points he should go to game regardless, but with 8 (maybe 7) he 
should look at his <span class="red">&diams;</span> holding to see if he can help you in the suit. If so, he bids the game, 
if not, he returns to 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.
<br><br>
With this hand he would bid 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; K 7
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> J 8 5 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> 5 4 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; Q J 9 2
<br><br>
But with this hand he would bid 4<span class="red">&hearts;</span>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&spades; K 7
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&hearts;</span> J 8 5 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">&diams;</span> Q J 9 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&clubs; 5 4 2
<br><br>

20 examples will be worth more than another 1000 words.
