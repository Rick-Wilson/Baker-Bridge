<div align="center"><h2>Partnership Bidding Practice</h2></div>

All of us have probably sat around with a partner and dealt out random hands to try to get some bidding 
practice in. Some of them were useful but many were not. These pages contain many hands which have 
been pre-dealt for you, and they are all pertinent to the named topic.
<br><br>
Each topic has a brief Review and 24 Practice Deals.<br>
Clicking on any Deal takes you to a box where you choose to be NORTH or SOUTH.<br>
The basic idea is that the two partners are in verbal contact with each other, but are looking 
at just their own hand. For our partnership we each have a computer in the same room but we sit back to back. 
Perhaps you and your partner each have a laptop/pad to use while you're in a coffee shop. I'm sure you 
will get the idea and be creative.
<br><br>
So you bid verbally until you reach the final contract, then each of you click the BIDDING button to 
have a look at the "Recommended Bidding" and a few comments. 
<br><br>
The difficulty level of the sets varies with the topic. Obviously the Roman Key Card Blackwood topic is 
tougher than the Very Basic Notrump Bidding topic. Hopefully there is something here for everybody.
