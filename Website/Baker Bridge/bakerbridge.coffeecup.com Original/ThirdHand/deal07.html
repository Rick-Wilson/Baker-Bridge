		Play the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K.
		<br><br>
		Admittedly you have a terrible hand. But that's no reason to be careless. <b>YOU</b> can beat this 
		contract, but you have to do it right now by unblocking the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K. 
		If declarer holds up you will continue with your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>7 and partner 
		will establish his suit while he still has the &clubs;A for an entry. If declarer doesn't hold 
		up it will be just as bad for him.
		<br><br>
		But suppose you say "Well, partner's <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q is just as good as my 
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span>K so I'll just save the King for later" as you play low.<br>
		Declarer will love you. He will hold up on the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>Q, then again 
		on trick two when you play the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K. AND HE WILL STILL HAVE 
		HIS <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A when you switch to another suit. He will have time 
		to drive out the &clubs;A while he still has <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s stopped.
		<br><br>
		It was a good thing you held the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K rather than declarer, but it 
		is a nuisance that you must get out of the way on the very first trick.
