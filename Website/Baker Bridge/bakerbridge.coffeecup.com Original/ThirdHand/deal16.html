		Play the &spades;K.
		<br><br>
		It seems that perhaps you should play low and let partner's &spades;Q force out 
		South's &spades;A. Then, when you get the lead with a high &clubs; you can force out 
		South's &spades;J. Get the lead with your other high &clubs; and set the contract 
		with &spades;s.
		<br><br>
		Suppose you try that. Play low on the first &spades;.<br>
		South will also play low and West will be left holding the trick, and also holding the bag!<br>
		With no more &spades;s West will have to play one of the other three suits, and that is just 
		what South wants to have happen. The contract could no longer be beaten.
		<br><br>
		Now do it the right way.<br>
		Play your &spades;K on partner's &spades;Q. Assume South takes the trick, although it doesn't matter 
		whether he wins the first one or holds up.<br>
		When you win your first &clubs; drive out South's &spades;J.<br>
		When you win your second &clubs; trick your &spades;s will be good.<br>
		If you overtake the first trick the contract can no longer be made.
		<br><br>
		Notice that South will always make two &spades; tricks, so your overtake costs nothing.
