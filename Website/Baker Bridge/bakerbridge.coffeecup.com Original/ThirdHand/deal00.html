<h3>THIRD HAND PLAY</h3>

<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>

South will always be declarer and you will be in the East position.<br>
Partner has made the opening lead, declarer has played from dummy and it will be your turn to play.
<br><br>

Feel free to disagree with the bidding which is more or less Standard American, not 2-Over-1.
<br><br>

The first page of each Deal shows your hand, dummy's hand, the opening lead and the bidding.<br> 
You are asked to study the information available and decide what you would play.<br>
When you have decided click<font style="color:#000099">&nbsp;<b>NEXT</b></font>.
<br><br>

The next page shows all four hands.
<br><br><br>

<b>THIRD HAND LESSON</b>
<br><br>

If your only ambition is to be a better-than-average defender then you don't have to read this entire lesson.<br> 
Instead, just learn this one simple rule and you will be about 75% of good.
<br><br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
 <tr><td>When partner's opening lead is a low card and dummy holds no <br>
 high cards in the suit you should always play your highest card.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

That's it. It's called Third Hand High and Bridge teachers have been stressing it for many years.<br> 
The idea is that you don't want declarer to win the first trick with a small card. If your high card 
wins the trick, fine, but if not you want to force Declarer to use a high card to get the trick.
<br><br>

Here are a couple of examples.
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">
   		&spades; 8 5 3
    </td>
 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
		Defending against a Notrump contract your partner, West, leads the &spades;4.<br>
		If you correctly play your &spades;A and then return your &spades;6 your side will take 
		the first 5 &spades; tricks.<br>
		If you do not play the &spades;A on this trick declarer will win an undeserved trick, perhaps 
		the extra one he needs to make the conract.
	</td>

<tr>
 	<td>
   		&spades; K J 7 <b>4</b> 2

		You are certain that South holds the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>A because partner would not underlead 
		an Ace as the opening lead against a suit contract.<br>
		However, the lead of a low card does indicate an honor in the suit, so to protect that honor you must put your 
		<span class="red">&hearts;</span>K on the trick.<br> 
		If you get cheap and decide to save your <span class="red">&hearts;</span>K for later South will win the 
		first trick with the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>J and in fact won't lose a <span class="red">&hearts;</span> 
		trick at all.

There you have it. Play Third-hand-high and you will be a pretty darn good defender.<br>
But if you want to be an excellent defender, (and for times when you do not play Third-hand-high), read on.
<br><br><br>

<b>What to play when you have touching high cards:</b>
<br><br>

There is a very good common sense rule that is used most of the time in Bridge.
<br><br>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
 <tr><td>When leading one of equal honors, start with the highest one.<br>
When playing third hand one of equal honors, play the lowest one.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">
   		<span class="red">&diams;</span> 8 3 2
    </td>
 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
		Defending against a Notrump contract your partner, West, leads the <span class="red">&diams;</span>5.<br>
		You want to play third-hand-high, but that doesn't mean you should put on the 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span>Q.<br>
		Since you also have the <span class="red">&diams;</span>J, that is the card you should play.<br>
		It may seem that it wouldn't matter, and of course it doesn't matter <b>TO YOU</b>.<br>
		But put yourself on partner's side of the table. If you play the <span class="red">&diams;</span>Q 
		and South wins with the <span class="red">&diams;</span>A, West cannot tell where the 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span>J is, and will assume that South holds it.<br>
		But if you correctly play the <span class="red">&diams;</span>J and South wins with the 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span>A partner will know for sure that you also hold the 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span>Q, since if South held that card he would not have used 
		his <span class="red">&diams;</span>A to win the trick.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 	<td>
   		<span class="red">&diams;</span> K 10 7 <b>5</b>
 		</td>
    <td align="left"><img src="../tvs.gif"/></td>

Here is an obvious extension of that last example.
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">

		Dummy plays low and you want to play third-hand-high, but that doesn't mean you should put on the 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span>Q.<br>
		Since dummy has the <span class="red">&diams;</span>J, your <span class="red">&diams;</span>Q
		and <span class="red">&diams;</span>10 are equals so you play the <span class="red">&diams;</span>10.

</table>
<br><br>

<b>What if dummy has a high card:</b>
<br><br>

When dummy comes down with a high card that you can beat it is often better to keep your winner to 
quash the high card in dummy.
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">

 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
		Defending against a Notrump contract your partner, West, leads the &clubs;3.<br>
		Declarer plays the &clubs;5 from dummy.<br>
		In this example you can see that playing third-hand-high would be a mistake.<br>
		Partner's low &clubs; lead indicates he holds an honor, which might be the King.<br> 
		If you play your &clubs;A on this trick partner's &clubs;K will also win a trick but the 
		third trick in the suit will be taken by dummy's &clubs;Q.<br>
		Instead play your &clubs;J and your side can take the first four tricks.<br>
		In case you're worried that South might hold the &clubs;K then quit worrying. If he does 
		hold the &clubs;K and you put your &clubs;A on the trick then you will have established 
		TWO &clubs; winners for him. Play the &clubs;J and keep your &clubs;A to stop dummy's 
		&clubs;Q from being a winner.

		Defending against a Suit contract your partner, West, leads the &spades;2.<br>

		You should play the &spades;9 because if you you play your &spades;K South will win the &spades;A 
		and later make a second trick in the suit by leading toward the &spades;J.<br>
		If this is a Notrump contract the situation is more difficult because against Notrump partner might 
		have led from &spades; A Q 7 2. So against Notrump you use your best judgement (based on the bidding) 
		as to which is more likely for West; &spades; A Q 7 2 or &spades; Q 10 7 2.

<b>The Rule of Eleven</b>
<br><br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#0000cc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="background:#ccccff; margin-left:20px">
 <tr><td>
 When partner makes an opening lead that is fourth-highest, subtract the<br>
 value of that card from eleven. The result will be the number of cards in<br>
 dummy, your hand, and declarer's hand that are higher than the card led.</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

If you want to know more about this rule there is a full lesson on BakerBridge.<br>
Meanwhile, here are a couple of examples:
<br><br>

<table style="width:95%; table-layout:fixed">
<tr>
	<td style="valign:top; width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
   	<td style="width:6em">

    </td>
 	<td style="width:6em">&nbsp;</td>
	<td rowspan="3" valign="top">
		West leads the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>6, which you take to be fourth-highest.<br>
		The <span class="red">&hearts;</span>2 is played from dummy.<br>
		Subtract 11 - 6 and the answer is 5, the number of cards in North, East and South that are higher  
		than the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>6. Since you can see all five of those cards in your 
		hand and dummy, you play low and West's <span class="red">&hearts;</span>6 will hold the trick.<br>
		Notice that declarer would have been better of to cover the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>6 
		with dummy's <span class="red">&hearts;</span>7.

		You apply the Rule of Eleven; 11 - 5 = 6.<br>
		Since you can see 5 of the <span class="red">&diams;</span>s that are above the 5, you know that 
		South has just one card that can beat the <span class="red">&diams;</span>5. 
		It is very likely that this card is the <span class="red">&diams;</span>K, and while you cannot 
		prevent it from winning a trick you can force South to play it just by playing 
		the <span class="red">&diams;</span>6.<br>
		If you incorrectly play the <span class="red">&diams;</span>J South will win with the 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span>K and then score a second <span class="red">&diams;</span> 
		trick by finessing the <span class="red">&diams;</span>9 later.

<b>When partner leads an honor card:</b>
<br><br>

Partner will lead the top card of an honor sequence so you should be able to figure out his holding.<br>
Your first concern here is probably whether to signal for him to continue the suit or not.<br>
Another concern, though, is whether you have a high honor yourself that may cause the suit to be blocked.

		South will most likely hold up his &clubs;A.<br>
		When West continues the suit and your &clubs;K is played, South will hold up again. Since you 
		are now out of &clubs;s you will be unable to continue to attack in what is probably your 
		side's best suit.<br>
		Instead, you should play your &clubs;K. Now if South holds up you can continue the suit and if
