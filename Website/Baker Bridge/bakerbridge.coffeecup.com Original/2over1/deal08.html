		North opens 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span>, his 5-card Major.
		<br>
		
		South, with 14 points, naturally responds 2<span class="red">&diams;</span>, 
		forcing the partnership to game.
		<br><br>
		
		North next bids 2&spades;, showing the other Major suit. In standard bidding North would not be able 
		to bid the &spades;s since that would be a Reverse and North is far too weak to Reverse. But after a 
		2/1 Response the concept of a Reverse does not apply, and the priority of showing a 4-card Major 
		certainly does apply.
		<br><br>
		
		South assumes North to be 4-5 in the Majors, so she cannot support either. She bids 2NT. If North actually 
		has 6 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s (or 5 &spades;s) he will rebid the suit. 
		South's 2NT bid guarantees a stopper in the fourth suit.
		<br><br>
		
		North does not have either 6 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s or 5 &spades;s so he just bids 3NT. 
		Notice that North never once 
		considered the possibility of passing what might be a misfit - the initial 2/1 response unconditionally 
		forced the partnership to reach a game somewhere.
