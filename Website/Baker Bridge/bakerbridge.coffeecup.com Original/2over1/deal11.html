		North opens 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> and South responds 2&clubs;.<br>
		
		Using standard bidding North would now jump to 3NT to show his 19 points, but in 2/1 this is not 
		necessary since the partnership must not stop bidding until game is reached. So North just bids 2NT. 
		South shows her minimum by bidding 3NT.
		<br><br>
		
		North will now disclose his extra strength. He bids 4NT. This is not Blackwood, but rather a quantitative 
		raise in Notrump, and an invitation to slam.
		<br><br>
		 
		South has 15 points, and they are good ones. She accepts the invitation and bids 6NT.
		<br><br>
		
		There are 11 top tricks. A 3-3 <span class="red">&hearts;</span> split would provide the 12th winner, but this 
		is against the odds. Better to try two &spades; finesses, a 75% chance.
