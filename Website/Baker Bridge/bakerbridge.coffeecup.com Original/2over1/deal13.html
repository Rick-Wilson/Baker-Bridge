		North opens 1&spades;.<br>
		South has a powerhouse, plenty strong enough to jump-shift. But playing 2/1 it's usually simpler when 
		you make the 2/1 response, and save your jumping for later - if at all. So South bids just 
		2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>, knowing North must keep the bidding open.
		<br><br>
		
		North knows South has at least 5 <span class="red">&hearts;</span>s, so his first priority is to 
		agree on the trump suit. He bids 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.
		<br><br>
		 
		South now makes the slam try. She knows North has at least three trumps, and all she wants to find out is 
		how many Aces/Kings North holds. So she bids Blackwood and North confesses to two Aces.
		<br><br>
		
		Still hoping for the Grand, South bids 5NT. Oops, North doesn't have any kings so South settles for 
		a small slam.
		<br><br>
		
		This is a good slam, cold if West makes any opening lead other than a &clubs;. 
		With a &clubs; lead, South will have to pull trumps and play to discard a loser on 
		the &spades;10.
