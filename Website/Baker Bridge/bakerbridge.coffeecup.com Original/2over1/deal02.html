		North opens 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> and South, with 16 points,  
		responds 2<span class="red">&diams;</span>, forcing the partnership to game.
		<br><br>
		
		North has a minimum strength hand, but with a 6-card suit he rebids 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.
		<br><br>
		
		Opposite North's 6-card suit, South's doubleton is adequate support. If South had a minimum 
		for her 2/1 response she might just jump to 4<span class="red">&hearts;</span> to show no interest 
		in slam. With a little extra she bids 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> since she knows 
		the bidding cannot stop until game is reached. From South's perspective North might have a big hand; his 
		2-level rebid shows suit length but does not say anything about strength. This is one of the beauties 
		of 2/1, the bidding can be kept low while you look for the best place to play. However, this time 
		North merely bids the game and South passes.
		<br><br>
		
		The hand would have been bid the same with or without 2/1.
