		The purpose of the hold-up play is to cut communications between the two defenders. So the general 
		guideline is to hold up until you are sure one of the defenders is void in the suit - maybe twice, 
		maybe only once, and in this case not at all.
		<br><br>
		But one of the important considerations you have to think about is the possibility that the 
		Defense will switch to another suit - where you might be in even more trouble.
		<br><br>
		You'd feel bad on this hand if you let East hold the <span class="red">&hearts;</span>10 only to see him 
		next lay down the &spades;J.
