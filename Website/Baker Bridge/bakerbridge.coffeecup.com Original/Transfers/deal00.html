<h3>JACOBY TRANSFERS</h3>
<br>
<b>ABOUT THE DEALS</b>
<br><br>
You may be either Opener or Responder, but you will always be in the South position.
<br><br>
The first page or two of each Deal shows only your hand. The initial bidding is given and you are asked to decide 
what you would bid, then click <font style="color:#000099"><b>BID</b></font>. 
The subsequent page will then appear telling you what you should have bid and continuing the auction. 
On the final page of each Deal partner's hand will be shown.
<br><br>
Feel free to disagree with some of the bids that do not apply directly to Transfers. Deals 9 and 21 for example.
<br><br>
Although it is not included in the Deals you might wish to examine your and dummy's hand and make a Plan 
of how you would play the contract.
<br><br>

<b>JACOBY TRANSFERS SUMMARY</b>
<br><br>
Created by Oswald Jacoby a lot of years ago, there are two good reasons to use Transfers.<br>
<ol>
  <li>They provide a precise bidding method when the Responder to a 1NT opening has a 5 or 6 card Major suit.</li>
  <li>They make the opening 1NT hand the declarer, keeping the stronger hand concealed.</li>
</ol>
Jacoby Transfers should only be used in conjunction with the Stayman Convention. The two work smoothly together with 
Stayman taking care of those hands where Responder has a 4-card Major(s) and Jacoby Transfers taking care of those 
hands where Responder has a 5- or 6-card Major.
<br><br>
The actual working of transfer bids is simple:<br>
After a 1NT opening a 2<span class="red">&diams;</span> response requires Opener to bid 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>, while a 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span> 
response requires Opener to bid 2&spades;.<br>
On his next bid Responder clarifies the picture by either placing the contract or by inviting Opener to do so. 
<br><br>
Jacoby Transfers take much of the guesswork (sometimes called judgement) out of the bidding and steer you directly 
to these two goals:
<ol>
  <li>With a partnership 26 points you will reach game, with 33 you will reach slam.</li>
  <li>With a partnership 8+ cards in a Major suit you will play in that suit, otherwise you will play notrump.</li>
</ol>
For the first point consider this table which is based on the 1NT opener holding 15-17 points.

<br><br>
Responder's actions are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>8 points or fewer - either pass or transfer and then pass</li>
  <li>9 points - invite partner to game</li>
  <li>10 points - either invite or force to game, using your judgement</li>
  <li>11-15 points - force to game</li>
  <li>16 points - invite to slam</li>
  <li>17 points - either invite or force to slam, using your judgement</li>
  <li>18 points or more - force to slam</li>
</ul>
Opener's actions are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>15 points - decline invitations</li>
  <li>16 points - either decline or accept, using your judgement</li>
  <li>17 points - accept invitations</li>
</ul>
As to the second point above (the 8-card trump fit) you must keep in mind that it is correct to 
open 1NT with 5-3-3-2 distribution, so it is possible for Opener to have a doubleton in the Major suit 
that Responder is interested in. Therefore Responder must bid differently with a 5-card suit than 
he does with a 6-card suit.
<ul>
  <li>With a 5-card Major Responder transfers Opener to that Major suit, then at his next turn bids notrump.</li>
  <li>With a 6-card Major Responder transfers Opener to that Major suit, then at his next turn rebids the suit.</li>
</ul>
Opener also has to keep on the right track when Responder has shown only 5 of the suit by rebidding notrump.
<ul>
  <li>With 2 cards in the transferred suit Opener stays with notrump.<br></li>
  <li>With 3+ cards in the transferred suit Opener returns to the Major suit.</li>
</ul>
Some comments are in order about the point count methods used on these pages.
<ul>
  <li>Initial point count for both hands is based on 4-3-2-1 plus one point for a fifth card in a suit.</li>
  <li>Revalued points (only after a trump fit is discovered) are +1 for a doubleton held by Opener.</li>
  <li>Responder must be very cautious about adding short-suit revalued points. As the long-trump hand 
  Responder will not be able to gain a trick by ruffing since it usually uses a trump which would be 
  a winner anyway. </li>
</ul>
<br>
25 examples will be worth more than another 1000 words.
