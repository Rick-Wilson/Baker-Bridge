		but even if he does he is the Safe Hand and cannot play a &spades; without giving you 
		a trick. And whatever else he could play you would win and make 4 <span class="red">&diams;</span> tricks. 
		In the actual Deal the <span class="red">&diams;</span> finesse actually works and you make all 5 
		tricks in the suit.
