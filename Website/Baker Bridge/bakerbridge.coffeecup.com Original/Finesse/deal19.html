		<br><br>
		OK, now it is time to figure out where that extra trick is coming from. Not much figuring is needed, it 
		must come from the <span class="red">&diams;</span> suit. Since you are missing 5 cards including the Queen, the 
		odds favor a finesse over playing for the drop. And, since you have the option of finessing either defender 
		are you going to finesse into the one who can set you or into the safe one?
		<br><br>
		Silly question. Of course you play the <span class="red">&diams;</span>K from your hand, then a small <span class="red">&diams;</span> 
		finessing dummy's <span class="red">&diams;</span>10, which wins the trick - and the game - and the overtrick.

		Actually the odds slightly favored East holding the <span class="red">&diams;</span>Q because East started 
		with only 2 &spades;s compared to West's 5 &spades;s. Therefore East 
		had 11 spaces which could hold the <span class="red">&diams;</span>Q whereas West only had 8 spaces.
		<br><br>
		But in a situation like this you don't play odds. By finessing West you guaranteed making the 
		contract even if the finesse lost because East had no more &spades;s. Even a losing 
		<span class="red">&diams;</span> finesse would have established the one trick you needed.
