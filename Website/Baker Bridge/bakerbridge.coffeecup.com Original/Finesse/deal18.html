		The Backward Finesse if a pretty rare play. It is against the odds so you only try it when you are 
		absolutely certain that a normal finesse is doomed to fail.
		<br><br>
		Like this time.
		<br><br>
		By the way. Those of you with great short-term memories might think they have seen this hand before. Well, 
		you ALMOST have. Deal 8 has an almost identical layout but a much simpler theme. Check it out.
