		South considered Blackwood, then realized if North showed either 2 or 3 Aces he was going to bid slam.<br>
		But if North showed just one Ace he would have to maneuver to play 5NT which might be worse than 6&clubs;.<br>
		So he just bid the slam.<br>
		South plays 6&clubs;. West leads the &spades;J.
