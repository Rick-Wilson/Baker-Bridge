A perfect Michaels example; 5-5 in the Majors and 9 points. You bid 2\D and partner says 2\S. What do you bid next? [BID pass]

[show NS]



You have a rather minimum Michaels type hand and you asked partner to choose a Major suit. He chose \Ss. But don't start thinking about what great support you have for his \S suit, he doesn't HAVE a \S suit, he is just supporting yours. In other words, you pass.}

[show NS]



As mentioned, you have a pretty good hand, but partner only bid because you forced him to and he showed nothing more than minimum. So you pass.}

Of course you bid a Michaels Cue-Bid of 2\S. Partner says 4\H. What do you bid now? [BID pass]

[show NS]



Partner's jump might indicate he has a really good hand, or he might just have a really good fit. You certainly don't have the strength to make another move so you pass. A good thing, too. Partner might get lucky and make this but it looks like the other guys are cold for 4\S. Even if partner loses 2 \H tricks and goes down 1 it will turn out to be a good sacrifice.}

With the two lowest unbid suits you bid 2NT. Partner jumps to 4\D. What do you bid? [BID pass]

[show NS]



Partner probably has a good hand, but he might just be preempting. Assuming he is inviting you to bid game you have a tough decision. You are not very strong but you might have been a couple of points weaker. It is strictly a judgement call and we decide to pass.

As you can see, IF they open the lead with a \C, and IF the \H finesse then works, you can make 5\D.}

The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? [BID 3\S]

[show NS]



As you have figured out by now, using Michaels Cue-Bids / Unusual Notrump is sometimes hard to tie down. Here you have 13/14 points and if you figure partner for 9 that won't be enough for game. But, those two Minor Aces are worth a lot when you figure partner has only 3 Minor suit cards.

So let's say you decide to just invite with 3\S. Partner takes you to game.

You will surely make this game if trumps split 2-2. If they don't then you will have to hope for a defensive mistake.}

With 5 cards in the "other" Major and a 5-card Minor suit this looks like an ideal Michaels Cue-Bid, right? No, not really. While it would not be a capital offense to bid 2\H here, it generally works out better with 13-16 point hands to just overcall in your higher-ranking suit. You bid 1\S. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid? [BID 4\S]

[show NS]



Partner's cue-bid shows a limit-raise or better in \Ss. So you bid 4\S without the blink of an eye.}

Yes, you have a high-level Michaels hand but don't get carried away. Remember that you forced partner to bid. Any bid at all by you at this point will show 17+ points, so you just raise to 3\H. Partner has a weak hand and passes.}

Partner may have as few as zero points and as many as 13 or so. You COULD bid an invitational 3\S, but if he has only 5 or 6 points he will pass. Looking at your hand you only need to find partner with \S J x x to have a good shot at game. So go ahead and bid 4\S.

Partner apparently has a big hand. His cue-bid is forcing, and probably means he wants to be in game. But for now you can just show your minimum strength and give a suit preference. You bid 4\C and partner raises to 5\C.}
