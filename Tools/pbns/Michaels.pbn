The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? [BID 2\D]



A perfect Michaels example; 5-5 in the Majors and 9 points. You bid 2\D and partner says 2\S. What do you bid next? [BID pass]



You have a rather minimum Michaels type hand and you asked partner to choose a Major suit. He chose \Ss. But don't start thinking about what great support you have for his \S suit, he doesn't HAVE a \S suit, he is just supporting yours. In other words, you pass.}

You have a fair hand with a guaranteed 8-card fit in either Major. You are not, however, strong enough to jump the bidding. So you bid 2\H, which is passed out.}

You have a pretty good hand for an Unusual Notrump, but not so good that you wouldn't use the convention. You bid 2NT and partner says 3\C. What do you say next? [BID pass]



As mentioned, you have a pretty good hand, but partner only bid because you forced him to and he showed nothing more than minimum. So you pass.}

Your best suit is \Hs. But partner didn't ask you to bid \Hs, he asked you to pick a Minor. You know you will have an 8-card fit in \Ds so you take the safe approach and bid 3\D. Everybody passes.}

Of course you bid a Michaels Cue-Bid of 2\S. Partner says 4\H. What do you bid now? [BID pass]



Partner's jump might indicate he has a really good hand, or he might just have a really good fit. You certainly don't have the strength to make another move so you pass. A good thing, too. Partner might get lucky and make this but it looks like the other guys are cold for 4\S. Even if partner loses 2 \H tricks and goes down 1 it will turn out to be a good sacrifice.}

The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? [BID 2NT]



With the two lowest unbid suits you bid 2NT. Partner jumps to 4\D. What do you bid? [BID pass]



Partner probably has a good hand, but he might just be preempting. Assuming he is inviting you to bid game you have a tough decision. You are not very strong but you might have been a couple of points weaker. It is strictly a judgement call and we decide to pass.

As you can see, IF they open the lead with a \C, and IF the \H finesse then works, you can make 5\D.}

The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? [BID 3\S]



As you have figured out by now, using Michaels Cue-Bids / Unusual Notrump is sometimes hard to tie down. Here you have 13/14 points and if you figure partner for 9 that won't be enough for game. But, those two Minor Aces are worth a lot when you figure partner has only 3 Minor suit cards.

So let's say you decide to just invite with 3\S. Partner takes you to game.

You will surely make this game if trumps split 2-2. If they don't then you will have to hope for a defensive mistake.}

With 5 cards in the "other" Major and a 5-card Minor you bid 2\S, Michaels of course. Partner bids 2NT. What do you say next? [BID 3\D]



Is it possible that partner wants to play Notrump? Not at all. He hates \Hs and wants you to bid your Minor suit. So you say 3\D and he passes.}

Partner asked you to choose between \Hs and \Ds so you bid 3\D. He then raises you to 4\D. What do you bid? [BID 5\D]



If you say to yourself "I only have 7 HCP" then you might pass. But if you say "Partner invited me to bid game, even though I might have no points and only 3 trumps. I'm a lot better than that.", then you will accept the invitation. So you bid 5\D and everybody passes.}

With 5 cards in the "other" Major and a 5-card Minor suit this looks like an ideal Michaels Cue-Bid, right? No, not really. While it would not be a capital offense to bid 2\H here, it generally works out better with 13-16 point hands to just overcall in your higher-ranking suit. You bid 1\S. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid? [BID 4\S]



Partner's cue-bid shows a limit-raise or better in \Ss. So you bid 4\S without the blink of an eye.}

Partner only made a minimum bid, so you have no choice but to pass.}

With 18 points and 5-5 Major suits you are up in the high-level Michaels category. You bid 2\D and partner responds 2\H. What do you bid next? [BID 3\H]



Yes, you have a high-level Michaels hand but don't get carried away. Remember that you forced partner to bid. Any bid at all by you at this point will show 17+ points, so you just raise to 3\H. Partner has a weak hand and passes.}

You have 20 points and two good 5-card Majors so you bid a Michaels 2\C. Partner responds 2\S. What do you say next? [BID 4\S]



Partner may have as few as zero points and as many as 13 or so. You COULD bid an invitational 3\S, but if he has only 5 or 6 points he will pass. Looking at your hand you only need to find partner with \S J x x to have a good shot at game. So go ahead and bid 4\S.

Will you look at that. Partner has only 2 points, but what great ones to have!}

This is a really good hand for Unusual Notrump. You bid 2NT and partner says 3\S. What do you say now? [BID 4\C]



Partner apparently has a big hand. His cue-bid is forcing, and probably means he wants to be in game. But for now you can just show your minimum strength and give a suit preference. You bid 4\C and partner raises to 5\C.}
