West found the best opening lead for his side, exposing your \S losers before you could establish the \C suit for a discard. If you start to pull trumps right away the defense will grab the \HA, then take their two \S tricks and you will still have the \CA that you cannot avoid.

Other than the \DA the only useful card in dummy is the \DQ so you must try to make a winner out of that for a  discard. So win the \SA, lead your singleton \D and finesse the \DQ. Your luck has returned, the \DQ wins and you discard one of your \S losers on the \DA.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

At this point you have not lost any tricks, and you can see that you have only 3 losers remaining in your hand. So you start pulling trumps and establishing the \Cs.

You need one more winner from the \H or \C suit. The straight finesse of the \HK offers a 50% chance of success. The double finesse of the \C K Q offers a 75% chance of success. It's a no-brainer. Run 4 \Ss and 5 \Ds ending in your hand. Be very careful not to discard a \C from your hand.

Lead a small \C and play the \CT if West plays low. Let's say East wins the \CK and returns a \H.

DO NOT FINESSE THE \H. Stick with your original 75% plan. Take the \HA and play your small \C, finessing the \CJ. This is why you couldn't discard a \C earlier.

West has made another great lead. Any other suit would have given you a free finesse. You should duck the first \D. It is very possible that West has led from \D K Q T and will be afraid to continue for fear you have the \DJ in your hand. You'd be very happy to see him switch to any other suit. But he doesn't, he continues with the \DQ which you take with dummy's \DA.

You are in dummy for the first, last, and only time. You need to try a finesse right now, but which one? At first you might think it makes no difference but, in fact, there is only one reasonable choice. If you finesse the \SK successfully you may still have a \S loser. If you finesse the \HK successfully you will surely still have a \H loser. But if you finesse the \CK successfully you will eliminate your \C loser.

Your only hope for ridding yourself of two of those losers is dummy's \C suit. One possibility would be to finesse West for the \CK, and if that works, discard your \H loser on the \CA. You could then establish another \C winner for one of the \D losers. The problem with that plan is that if the finesse fails the defense will immediately take the setting \H trick.

A better plan is a ruffing finesse. Win the first trick with your \HA and pull trumps with your \S K Q. 

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

Next play your \C7 to dummy's \CA. Then lead the \CQ from dummy. If East plays the \CK you will ruff, enter dummy, and discard two red losers on the \C J T. If East plays low instead, you discard your \H loser. West may be able to win the trick but you can ruff a \H return, and dummy will have two good \Cs on which you can discard 2 \D losers.

It is an easy choice. The defenders only have 12 HCP and West opened the bidding. So you know he must have both of the cards you are interested in.

You don't really have 2 \H losers since both of them can be ruffed in dummy. The 2 \S losers are real, though, and must be dealt with.

In addition to the trumps, dummy has another useful card, the \HJ. You can give yourself a second chance by playing West to hold the \HQ.

Ruff the opening \C lead, pull trumps with the \DK, (they split 1-1), and play a low \H toward the \HJ. West fidgets, then puts on the \HQ and plays another \C which you ruff.

A. Conan Doyle would have called this "The Tale of Two Queens". You need to find one more trick and to do so you are going to have to find either the \HQ or the \CQ. You can finesse East for the \HQ, and you can finesse either defender for the \CQ.

Neither, yet. First take your 8 winners in \Ss and \Ds, hoping somebody discards something to help you. They don't.

It always pays to look for a second chance. Here you try to drop the \CQ, and if it doesn't work you have the finesse for the \HQ in reserve. 

Why not try to drop the \HQ and keep the finesse for the \CQ in reserve? Because you and dummy had 8 \Cs between you and only 6 \Hs. So the \CQ was far more likely to be doubleton than the \HQ.}

You need to get one more winner and it will have to be a \S winner. You could lead toward the \SQ, winning a trick if West holds BOTH the \SA and \SK. Or you could finesse the \ST, gaining a trick if West holds the \SJ. Obviously the second choice is more likely.

If it had not dropped you would just have played a third round of \Ss, hoping for a 3-3 split in the suit.

East follows once, then discards a \S and a \H.

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 3  \D = 2    \C = 2 Total = 8

There are two possibilities for getting an extra winner. If the \Ds are splitting 3-3 you could play \DA, \DK and another \D and establish the thirteenth \D as a winner. Or you could play East for the \SK and lead toward your \SQ.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

The chance of East holding the \SK is a little greater than 50%. (it is higher than the usual 50% because we know he started with only one \C, giving him more spaces for other cards).

The chance of \Ds splitting 3-3 is about 40%.

So you should enter dummy with a \H and play a small \S toward your \SQ.

Did it work? Click NEXT to see. [NEXT]

The problem is that you might run into this very distribution. You would establish a \D for East and when you played a \S from dummy East would jump up with the \SK and cash his winning \D for down 1.}

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 2  \D = 1    \C = 4 Total = 8

You only need one more winner. If East has the \SK or the \HQ a simple finesse will give you the trick.

There are two problems though. The first one is that if West gets in he may take too many \D tricks. But the bigger problem is that East cannot possibly have either of those two high cards. You and dummy together hold 28 HCP and West must surely hold the other 12 since he opened the bidding. Neither simple finesse will work so you must try what is called a Backward Finesse.

Hold up the \DA until the third round to confirm that East has only 2. He does. Then play four rounds of \Cs ending in your hand.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

Now play the \HJ. If West doesn't cover, you will let it ride for your ninth trick. But West does cover so you must take dummy's \HA. Next play a small \H from dummy and finesse the \H9, hoping East has the \HT. This is the Backward Finesse.

Like this time.

By the way. Those of you with great short-term memories might think they have seen this hand before. Well, you ALMOST have. Deal 8 has an almost identical layout but a much simpler theme. Check it out.}

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 2  \D = 2    \C = 3 Total = 8

Before worrying about where that one winner is going to come from you need to decide what to do with the opening lead. A good guideline is to hold up unless you fear a switch. Here, with all other suits well protected you would welcome a switch, so you let East win the \SQ. East then plays the \S8. Do you hold up again?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

It probably doesn't matter, but since you cannot possibly win more than T tricks you might just as well hold up again. West wins the \SJ then plays the \S3. East discards a \H on the third \S.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

OK, now it is time to figure out where that extra trick is coming from. Not much figuring is needed, it must come from the \D suit. Since you are missing 5 cards including the Queen, the odds favor a finesse over playing for the drop. And, since you have the option of finessing either defender are you going to finesse into the one who can set you or into the safe one?

Silly question. Of course you play the \DK from your hand, then a small \D finessing dummy's \DT, which wins the trick - and the game - and the overtrick.

But in a situation like this you don't play odds. By finessing West you guaranteed making the contract even if the finesse lost because East had no more \Ss. Even a losing \D finesse would have established the one trick you needed.}

Losers:   \S = 0    \H = 1  \D = 0    \C = 1 Total = 2

This looks like a very simple plan. Since the hands have mirrored distribution there will be no discards anywhere. That means the \CK MUST be in West's hand or you will go down. But is that all there is to it?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

If West has \C K x or \C K x x then yes, that's all there is to it. But if he has \C K x x x then you won't have enough entries to your hand unless you take the first \C finesse BEFORE you start on trumps.

So win the \HA and immediately play a \C to dummy's \CJ, which holds the trick. Then pull trumps, (it takes 4 rounds), ending in your hand.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

Next play your \CT, putting on the \C5 from dummy when West plays low again. This lets you stay in your hand to play another \C to the \CQ, picking up all four \C tricks and the slam.

Clickfor the complete Deal. [NEXT]

But also you had to play to one of dummy's honors first so you could retain that \C5 for letting you stay in your hand to make the third finesse. Bridge is great.}
