South is to play 3NT. West leads the \C3.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 0    \H = 5  \D = 1    \C = 2 Total = 8

You only need one more winner and your \S K Q will provide it. So, is there anything that could go wrong? - - Like could you mess up your entry?

Click [NEXT]



Suppose you play the \CJ from dummy on the first trick. And then suppose West puts the \CQ on. If you take your \CA you have used your entry to the \S K Q before you established one of them. But if you don't take the trick East will play another \C to remove dummy's \CK with the same effect. So what should you do?

Click [NEXT]



It's easy once you think about it. Just win the opening lead with dummy's \CK. Then, while it's fresh in your mind play to your \S K Q to establish the one extra winner you need. Then it's just a question of taking your winners.

South is to play 3NT. West leads the \D5. You play the \D9 from dummy and East plays the \D4.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 2  \D = 2    \C = 0 Total = 5

The bad news is that you must come up with 4 more winners! The good news is dummy's \C suit.

You can drive out the \CA, then get over to dummy for those \C winners. You will be able to get over to dummy, won't you?

Click [NEXT]



Not if you let the \D9 hold the first trick. The defender with the \CA will hold it up until the third round, then West will be able to play his \DK so as to prevent you from entering dummy.

But take first trick with the \DA and the \D Q J will be there guaranteeing you an entry to those two good \Cs.

It goes against the grain to put your \DA on a trick that dummy has already won with the \D9. It seems like you are wasting a trick.

But look carefully at the \D situation. You are going to get exactly two \D tricks no matter when you play your \DA. So you don't lose a trick, but you do gain an entry.}

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 2    \H = 0  \D = 1    \C = 1 Total = 4

Looks like you're going to need some \D tricks. Lots of them. And it also looks like you are going to have to be very careful with entries, which shouldn't surprise you at this time. So what is your first key move?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



The \C situation is exactly the same as the \Ds in Deal 2, but flipped North to South. And you must handle it exactly the same way - jump up with the \CA right away to preserve the \C Q J combination as a sure entry to your hand.

Having done that, are your problems (and thinking) over?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Not quite, there is one more hurdle to hurdle. You must put all thought of a \D finesse far out of your mind. Play \DA, then \DT, overtaking with \DJ and continuing the suit until the King appears. Now you should be able to come to 9 tricks unless there is a very unfortunate distribution which lets the defenders score 3 \H tricks along with their 1 \C and 1 \D.

South is to play 4\H. West leads the \CA, \C K, \CQ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Losers:   \S = 1    \H = 0  \D = 1    \C = 2 Total = 4

There is nothing to be done about the 2 \Cs you've already lost, and the \D loser is also inescapable. So you cannot afford a \S loser which means you will have to find the \SK with East and finesse him out of it.

That won't be a problem, will it?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



No, no problem. You will probably have to finesse twice so you will need two dummy entries, but the trump suit will provide both of those, the \HA and \H7, as long as you saved your \H5 for the second entry. Wait a minute, you surely didn't ruff that \C with your \H5 did you? Surely you ruffed with the \H8?

So, you ruffed the \C with the \H8, pulled one round of trumps with the \HK, pulled the last trump by playing \H9 to \HA and finessed the \S. Then \H5 to \H7, finesse the \S a second time. Play \SA and ruff the fourth \S in dummy.

Click NEXT to see it all. [NEXT]

[show NESW]

If you ruffed with the \H8 that is a good sign. But remember, this is the fourth Deal of a set where you are watching entries carefully.

Ask yourself if you would have done the correct thing at the table, say playing for the Bermuda Bowl championship.}

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 2  \D = 1    \C = 5 Total = 9

Wow! The winners add up to 9 already. We have assumed that \Cs will split no worse than 3-1, which is exactly how they do split. Is there any other pitfall you might need to worry about?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Just one minor problem. The \Cs will block if you are not careful! So you win the \SA, then play dummy's \CQ. Next you play dummy's \C8 to your \CK. Then your \CA on which you put dummy's \C7. Aha! Now when you play your \C6 you will be able to keep the lead.

Winners:   \S = 3    \H = 1  \D = 1    \C = 2 Total = 7

Needing two winners you will naturally consider your 5-card \C suit. After unblocking the \C A K you will need two entries to your hand; one to lead the \CJ and drive out the \CQ, then a second to enjoy your good \Cs.

The \S suit will provide one entry easily, but should you depend on the \HQ for the second entry?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



No, for two reasons. Firstly the \HQ only gives you a 50% chance of being an entry. But more importantly, you already have your two sure entries in \Ss. As long as you take the first trick with dummy's \SA both your \SK and  \SJ can be entries.

Win the \SA. Play off dummy's \C A K. Lead the \S9 to your \SJ. Play your \CJ (and another one if necessary) to establish the \C suit. Win whatever red card they play next with dummy's Ace. Play the \SQ to your \SK and cash your established ! C(s). Dummy's other red Ace will be your ninth trick.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 1  \D = 4?    \C = 3 Total = 9

Although you have 4 \D winners, getting to the last couple might not be so easy. You can make 3 \D tricks simply by winning your \DA, then overtaking your \DJ with dummy's \DQ. But you need that fourth \D winner. Can you get it?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Sure you can, by creating an entry in \Cs. It is likely from the opening lead, (and East's play of a small card), that West has led from \C Q T 7 5. If you win the first trick cheaply then you will still make your \C A K for three \C tricks in all.

So don't win cheaply, win the first trick with the \CA. Then unblock your \D A J. Next play \CK. (on which East discards), and a small \C toward dummy's \C J 9. You are sure to have a \C entry to dummy's \Ds, and you will still get three \C tricks, just a different three.

Suppose the opening lead had been a \D rather than a \C.

You probably would have played the hand the same way you just did, unblock \Ds, then play \C A K and a low \C toward the \C J 9 trying to get a \C entry to dummy.

It is only because the \C opening lead gives you the chance for a Cheap-Trick that you are tempted to go wrong.}

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 0  \D = 4    \C = 1 Total = 6

You are going to have to be pretty lucky to make this contract. You cannot touch the \H suit because a defender would take the \HA and it would start raining \Ss.

So you will have to get 3 extra \C winners, which means the \C finesse absolutely MUST work.

In addition to lucky, you are going to have to be pretty good, too. You will surely have to finesse the \Cs at least twice; that means you need two dummy entries. Can you find them?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Maybe in \Ds. Play the \DK, then \DQ, watching the defender's cards carefully. When both follow twice you know there is only a single \D left out, so you play the \DJ to dummy's \DA. Now take the \C finesse. It works! Next play your \D5 to dummy's \D6 and take another \C finesse. Both defenders follow so your \Cs are good.

Partner's hand didn't turn out to be what you hoped for, you had in mind maybe the \HK and \DQ.

But this is what you got. First, be thankful West led a \D rather than a \H. Second, see if you can find a way to fight yourself over to dummy and those three beautiful \Ss.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



You have two possibilities for a \C entry, but you can only try one of them as you will see.

You can play a high \C and hope somebody plays the singleton \CT. Then your \C9 would be an entry. If this works you would probably make all 13 tricks, but the chances are very slim.

You can play a low \C to dummy's \C8. Assuming a defender takes the \CT you can win his return and enter dummy with the \C9. This play is guaranteed to give you the entry and is the one you should choose.

Just in case you were wondering about the chances of that singleton \CT, here is how you would figure it out.

When you are missing 4 cards the probability of a 3-1 split is about 50%.

But the singleton can be any one of four cards - in this case it can be the \CT, \C6, \C3 or \C2. So the chance of one of the opponents holding specifically the singleton \CT is only one-fourth of 50%, about 12.5%.}

South is to play 4\H. West leads the \SA, then \SK.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Losers:   \S = 1    \H = 0  \D = 3?    \C = 0 Total = 4?

This is the kind of hand that can get really messy if you aren't careful. You could ruff the \S, then try to ruff some \Ds, but the defense can prevent you by leading trumps when you give up the \D tricks. 

All in all a much better plan is to use dummy's \C suit after you unblock the Ace. The only flaw with that idea is that when you ruff the \S, unblock the \CA, then play two rounds of trumps ending in dummy, there will still be a trump left out. And the defender might ruff a \C before you can take the discards you need. Do you see a way around this?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Do NOT ruff the second \S in dummy, just discard a \D. If West plays a third \S you will ruff in your hand, then unblock the \CA, then pull trumps in 3 rounds ending in dummy. And run all those \C tricks. If West plays a trump or a \C the result will be the same. The defense can get one \D trick if they take it right now, but you still make your contract.

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 2  \D = 1    \C = 2 Total = 6

You have the possibility of one additional \S winner if West holds the \SK. However, \Ds is your best suit and if East holds the \DK you could gain all three winners that you need from that suit. But of course you need perhaps 2 dummy entries. Do you have them?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Well, you probably do. West's small \C lead probably indicates an honor, and with East playing the \CA you can be pretty sure that West holds the \CJ. So by playing your \CK underneath the \CA you set up a second entry to dummy via the \C finesse.

Assume East now plays a \H. Take your \HA and play a \C to dummy's \CT. Lead a \D and finesse the \DJ, which holds. Play another \C to dummy and finesse another \D. Now play your \DA and smile when the \DK drops and your fourth \D becomes a winner.

You are probably getting good at this by now. The way to make sure of a dummy entry is to pass up the Cheap Trick \H9 and win the first trick with the \HA. Since East did not play third-hand-high he probably doesn't have a high card to play. You are confident that West has led from the \HK so by taking the \HA at once you guarantee you can get back to dummy when you need to do so.

After you win the \HA you start on \Ss, and they hold-up their \SA for one round. But you can get to dummy and the rest of the \Ss by leading toward the \HQ.

South is to play 3NT. West leads the \H3, you play dummy's \HJ and East plays the \HQ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 0    \H = 1  \D = 4    \C = 1 Total = 6

Unless you want to go down really, really early you had better take your \HK right now. And unless you want to go down almost as early you'd better stay completely away from the \S suit. So that only leaves you the \C suit to get 3 more winners in. East will have to have \CK so you can finesse it. You are also going to have to be smart with entries. Got it?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



If East has just \C K x then one finesse, followed by the \CA to drop the \CK and a small \C back to dummy will give you the 4 \C winners you must have. But if East has \C K x x and refuses to cover then you will be able to establish the \Cs but will need an extra dummy entry to enjoy that last winner.

So win the \HK and play the \D K Q. If both defenders follow suit you can afford to overtake your \DJ with dummy's \DA. Now play the \CT and let it ride. If it holds the trick play another \C to your \CJ and then play the \CA, dropping East's \CK.

Enter dummy by playing your \D3 to the \D6 and take your established \C for the ninth trick.

Suppose a defender showed out on the second \D.

With only one outside entry to dummy your choices are limited.

You might play East for \C K x and lead a small to your \CJ, then play \CA.

Or you might try leading the \CQ hoping that East will see this as a time to "cover an honor with an honor".}

South is to play 3NT. West leads the \C4, you play dummy's \C5 and East plays the \C7.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 0  \D = 2    \C = 3 Total = 6

You'd really like to find 3 winners without broaching that \H suit, so you decide to pin your hopes on the \S finesse. But you have a problem. When you win the first trick with the \C9 your only safe entry to dummy is by leading your \CK to the \CA. And this uses up one of your \C winners! Do you see a way to avoid the problem?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Don't win the first trick with the \C9, win with the \CK. Then at trick two enter dummy by playing your \C9 and finessing the \CJ! You are pretty sure West has led from the \CQ so you expect this to work. Then play the \ST, underplaying your \S8. You had better cash the \CA next, then the \SQ, letting it ride if not covered. Finally, one last \S finesse gives you 4 \S winners.

This is another twist on the them of winning with a higher card than necessary.

Here it doesn't actually create an extra entry, it just preserves the one entry you have but saves you an actual trick.

Here is an interesting point. Suppose that West's opening lead had been a \H and East had taken the first four \H tricks then played a \D. You would have played the hand the same way! Take the \CK, then finesse the \CJ.}

South is to play 3NT. West leads the \SQ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 2    \H = 1  \D = 2    \C = 0 Total = 5

There they are, four perfectly good \H tricks and no straightforward way to reach them. On the other hand, (I should say "In the other hand"), you have the possibility of 6 \D tricks, if the \DQ drops, in which case you won't need the \H tricks at all. Can you work those two possibilities into a strategy?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Sure. The \D problem is that the outstanding \Ds may split 3-1 with one defender holding \D Q x x. So it would appear you could only get 5 \D winners. But you can thwart him like this.

Win the \S. Unblock the \HA. Now play the \DJ. If Mr. \D Q x x takes this trick dummy's \DT will become an entry to those wonderful \Hs. But if he cleverly refuses to win the \DQ, then it will fall under your \D A K and you will get all 6 \D tricks.

The biggest problem with this great play is that East probably doesn't know for sure what you are doing to him.

Maybe after the hand is over he will appreciate it more and congratulate you.}

South is to play 3NT. West leads the \D2.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 2  \D = 3    \C = 2 Total = 8

The reason the Winners list shows 1 \S is that the defenders are going to have to let you win dummy's \SK. If they take that then you'll have 4 \S winners in your hand!

So you only need one more winner really, and if you guess the \C finesse right you will have it. Which way will you finesse, and why?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



You will finesse through East. If he has the \CQ you will win all 3 \C tricks, but if West has the \CQ you may win even more. Just watch.

Win the opening \D lead in dummy. Play the \SK which the defenders are not about to take while you have a \C entry to your hand. Now play the \CT and pass it to West. If West takes the \CQ then you will have TWO entries to your hand, one to get there for a \S lead, and the other to reach the \S winners after you have driven out the \SA. But if West DOESN'T take the \CQ, or if East actually has it, then you will have 3 \C tricks and your contract.

South is to play 6NT. West leads the \ST.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Winners:   \S = 2    \H = 5  \D = 2    \C = 1 Total = T

You need two more winners and the best bet is to try to pick up three \C tricks. You will need the \CK and \CQ to lie in different hands, or both of them to be with East. That is about a 75% chance.

But you may need to make 3 finesses, so that means 3 entries to dummy, all of which must be in the \H suit. Can it be done?

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Of course it can. Win the \S lead in your hand and play the \HK, overtaking with dummy's \HA. Now play a \C to your \C9, which loses to West's \CK. West plays another \S.

Now play the \HT, and when West follows you are safe to overtake with dummy's \HJ since you can tell that East did not start with 4 \Hs. In fact, East shows out so it is West who started with 4 \Hs but that won't be a problem for you. Play another \C from dummy, finessing the \CT which wins.

Now play your \H3 toward dummy, finessing the \H8 when West follows with a low card. Play dummy's two \H winners, discarding \Ds,  then the low \C to your \CJ. Wow.

The making of a Plan is a very important step in being a good Declarer.

And as you have figured by now, assessing how many entries you are going to need is big part of that plan. Like here, if you had won a single \H trick in your hand then you wouldn't have had the three entries to dummy.}

Pretty bold bidding by South, but partner DID make a positive response. South is to play 6\S. West leads the \DQ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]



Losers:   \S = 0    \H = 0  \D = 2    \C = 1 Total = 3

OK, the plan is to get over to dummy for those two \H winners.

If you just play a small \C toward the \CQ that will work whenever West holds the \CK.

How about playing \CA an a small \C, planning on ruffing your third \C to get to dummy? Naaah. They will win the second \C and play a trump.

There is actually a play that is T0% certain, no matter who holds the \CK.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]



Win the opening lead and lay down your \CJ. The defense is helpless. If they take the \CJ with the \CK, then you have a dummy entry in the form of the \CQ. If they refuse to take the trick you will counter by next laying down the \CA, then ruffing a third \C to get to dummy and the two golden eggs.
