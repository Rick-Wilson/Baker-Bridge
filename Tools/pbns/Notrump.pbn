You dealt so it is your bid. What do you say? [BID 1NT]



With 4-3-3-3 distribution and 15 points this hand qualifies for a 1NT opening. You bid 1NT andpartner raises to 2NT. What do you bid now? [BID pass]



Partner's 2NT bid invites you to bid 3NT if you are at the top of your 15-17 point range. Since you have only 15 points you decline the invitation.}

You dealt so it is your bid. What do you say? [BID 1NT]



This hand has 17 points and one of the balanced distributions. When you have a hand that meets the requirements you should open 1NT. Do not worry about the lack of a \D stopper, you don't have to have all the suits stopped to open 1NT. You bid 1NT and partner raises to 2NT. What do you bid next? [BID 3NT]



You should count on partner for 9 points for his invitation. Your 17 brings the total to 26 so you bid 3NT.}

You dealt so it is your bid. What do you say? [BID 1NT]



Of course you open 1NT. Partner responds 2NT. What do you say? [BID 3NT]



With 15 points you decline invitations, and with 17 points you accept. But with 16 you have to use your judgement. Some players will just automatically bid 3NT when they have 16 points, preferring to err on the side of boldness than to possibly miss bidding a makeable game. Others prefer to base their decision on how good the hand looks.

With all the Ts and 9s this hand is stronger than 16 points, so you bid 3NT.}

You open 1NT. Again. This time partner jumps to 4NT. What do you bid? [BID pass]



Partner's bid is not Blackwood. It is called a Quantitative 4NT and he is telling you he has a balanced 16-17 point hand. He is inviting you to bid 6NT.

With 17 you accept invitations, with 15 you decline. You have 15 so you pass.

As you see, there are 9 easy tricks and you can probably set up another. But you have no chance to make slam.}

You have 11 top tricks and can easily set up one more in \Cs.}

This is the threequel to 4 and 5. With a "good 16" points you accept the invitation and bid 6NT.

As you might expect, this time the slam is not so certain, but there is a good chance. If either Minor suit finesse works you can make 12 tricks.}

[PLAY S:D4]



You open 1NT and partner replies 3\H. What do you say next? [BID 3NT]



With this bidding method, partner's bid shows at least 10 points and exactly 5 \Hs. He expects you to choose between 3NT and 4\H. Since you have just a doubleton in \Hs you choose 3NT.

NOTE: Jacoby Transfers are very useful for this type of hand.}

You open 1NT and partner says 3\D. It's your bid. [BID 3NT]



Partner has a great hand. A jump to 3 in a Minor suit almost always shows slam interest. But that's partner with interest, not you. You couldn't have a more minimum 1NT opening bid. 

So you just return to 3NT. Partner gives up and passes.}

Partner's jump to 3\C shows at least 5 \Cs and slam interest. Your hand is good enough to encourage that interest so you bypass 3NT and say 4\C. Partner now bids 4NT. What do you answer? [BID 5\D]



That is Blackwood. You admit to one Ace and partner bids 6\C.}

A 1NT overcall is almost the same as a 1NT opening. The range is increased to 15-18, but the main difference is that you must have the opponent's suit adequately stopped. Here you certainly have the stopper so you bid 1NT. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid next? [BID pass]



And the responses are the same also. Partner's 2\H bid is a signoff bid, often called a "drop dead" bid. So even though you really like the \Hs you pass. }

With partner's 15, 16 or 17 points added to your 16 the total assets are 31, 32 or 33. That's only one chance in 3 of having the points you need for slam. On the other hand you have a pretty good 16. So you bid 4NT, inviting partner to bid the slam. He will pass if he has only 15, so the worst thing that can happen is that he puts you in slam with only 32 points.

So you bid 4NT and guess what? He passes.}

Since partner opened 1NT he has at least 2 \Hs and you are assured of an 8-card fit. The only question is how high. With 10 points you are in the judgement zone.

But unless you play Jacoby Transfers there isn't a method for inviting with this kind of hand. You have to decide for yourself and bid either 2\H or 4\H. Take the optimistic view and bid the game.

As you see, it is going to take some luck.}
