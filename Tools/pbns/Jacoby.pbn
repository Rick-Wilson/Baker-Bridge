The bidding has gone as shown. It is your bid. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 1\S]



You open 1\S and partner responds 2NT. What do you say next? [BID 4\S]



With a minimum hand and no singletons you bid the game immediately. Partner has nothing to add so he passes.}

With 14 points and good 4-card support you bid a Jacoby 2NT. Partner next bids 3\H. What do you say now? [BID 4\S]



You couldn't hear much worse news. Partner has a singleton \H so your \H K J are not worth very much. You have nothing to do but return to the trump suit so you bid 4\S.}

The bidding has gone as shown. It is your bid. [BID 3\C]



You have just a little extra so you bid 3\C to show a singleton. Partner says 3\H and it is your bid again. [BID 3\S]



Partner's bid means he has first round \H control, obviously the \HA. But it also denies holding the \DA since control bids are made up-the-line. You show your lack of a Minor suit Ace by returning to 3\S. Partner signs off at game.

You could equally have just bid 4\S yourself.}

The bidding has gone as shown. It is your bid. [BID 2NT]



With opening hand and 4-card \S support this is an ideal Jacoby 2NT response. Partner says 3NT. What do you bid now? [BID 4\S]



North has some extra strength and a 5-card \S suit. This is the point in the bidding where you would make a control bid, showing an Ace. Well, you would if you actually had an Ace. The way you indicate your lack of a control is to just return the the agreed trump suit. So you bid 4\S and partner passes.}

Partner would have shown a red Ace if he had one. Since he doesn't have one, all thoughts of slam are off. You pass.}

The bidding has gone as shown. It is your bid. [BID 2NT]



With 15 points and four of partner's suit you naturally bid 2NT. Partner now jumps to 4\H. What do you say? [BID pass]



Partner's rebid of 4\H is not strong. He is using the Principle of Fast Arrival to indicate a minimum opening hand. Since you have nothing extra you pass quietly.}

Although you could show your singleton \C now it is usually more informative to show a second 5-card suit. So you say 4\D. Partner bids 4\H. What do you say? [BID pass]



Partner signed off, showing a minimum, so you have nothing further to say.}

Opening hand with 4-card trump support. You bid 2NT. Partner rebids 3\D. What do you say? [BID 4\H]



The news that partner has a singleton \D does NOT excite you. In fact it causes your hand to devalue a lot. So you use the Principle of Fast Arrival and bid 4\H.}

There isn't really anything else you want to know. You think you can make slam so you bid 6\H.}

This is Blackwood. You respond 5\H for two Aces and partner bids the slam.}

Partner has at least opening hand and he has 4 \Ss. There is only one thing you need to know - how many Aces he has. You bid Blackwood 4NT and he responds 5\S. What is your next bid? [BID 7NT]



The three Aces does it for you. You can count 7 \S tricks, 3 \H tricks, 2 \D tricks and 1 \C. That is 13 total so you go ahead and bid 7NT.}

The bidding has gone as shown. It is your bid. [BID 3\S]



You have an opening hand with four of partner's Major suit so naturally you want to force to game. Although you could bid a Jacoby 2NT, the presence of the singleton \S makes a Splinter Bid more attractive. So you double-jump to 3\S. Partner now bids 4\C. What do you say next? [BID 4\D]



Partner's 4\C bid is control showing, and indicates he is thinking slammish. You bid 4\D showing your control and partner bids 6\H.

As you can see, North should make 12 tricks by discarding one \C loser on your \DA.}

The bidding has gone as shown. It is your bid. [BID 3\S]



When the opponents interfere, Jacoby is off. Now a cue-bid response by partner shows a hand with good trump support, and a limit raise or better in strength. So partner might have a game forcing hand, but also might have only 11 points.

But he definitely has \S support. You show your minimum hand by bidding 3\S and he passes.}

The bidding has gone as shown. It is your bid. [BID 2NT]



Click back to Deal 12 for a quick comparison between the two hands. Almost identical, but this time your singleton is the \SK. Since it is not advisable to Splinter with a singleton Ace, King or Queen you just bid 2NT instead. Partner jumps to 4\H and you pass.

Note that in this hand the three points you credited for your \SK are completely wasted. And although partner has the same hand as he did in Deal 12, this time there is no chance of making slam. This shows why you don't Splinter with singleton Honors.}

When partner Splinters his singleton \C you should realize that the only thing that could keep you from making slam would be lack of Aces. So you bid 4NT. Partner shows only one Ace so you just sign off at 5\H.}

Your partner has a better than minimum hand with 6 \Ss. However, you have an average hand with no controls to show so you use the Principle of Fast Arrival and bid 4\S. Everyone passes.}

Partner's bid is game forcing. With a bare minimum, no singletons, you go ahead and sign off in game. Partner then says 4\S. What do you bid next? [BID 5\H]



Partner is definitely showing slam interest. If you had a first round control in either Minor suit you would bid it now. But you don't. So you sign of again, this time at 5\H. Partner finally gives up on the idea of slam and passes.}

You want to force partner to game while you describe your hand. So you make a Splinter Bid of 4\H. Partner replies 5\C. What do you bid next? [BID 5\H]



Partner has the \CA. Good. You are pretty worried about \Ds and also your 11 high card points. You are tempted to just sign off at 5\S but you shouldn't. You can make a control-bid below the 5\S level. So you bid 5\H. This tells partner that your Splinter must have been a \H void. Partner bids 6\S.}

You are being Blackwooded, and with three Aces you reply 5\S. That was apparently just what North wanted to hear, so he bid 7\S.}

Partner's Splinter Bid in \Cs has really made your hand look good. With no losers in trumps or \Cs you need to find out about the other two suits. So you invoke Blackwood and partner replies 5\H. What do you bid next? [BID 6\H]



If partner can take care of your three \C losers you will have just one \S loser at most. So you bid 6\H. Maybe you should have bid 7\H.}
