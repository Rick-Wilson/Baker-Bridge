The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 3NT]

Partner's 2NT bid invites you to bid game if you have a maximum hand. Your 17 points is certainly a maximum so you bid 3NT.

Click NEXT to continue. [NEXT]

Will you take your \SA immediately? or at trick 2? or trick 3?

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

You need 3 more tricks, and they must come from ! Cs. So you must drive out the \CA. The problem is that when the defenders win the \CA they may also take 4 \S tricks.

While you cannot guarantee the contract you can at least give yourself a better chance by holding up your \SA on the first trick, and also on East's \S continuation. You win the third \S with your \SA. [NEXT]

Now you drive out the \CA. There are four possibilities:West may win the \CA and cash two more ! Ss, down 1. West may win the \CA and cash just one ! Ss, you make it. East may win the \CA and have a fourth \S to lead, you make it. East may win the \CA and be out of ! Ss, you make it.

Click NEXT to see the full deal. [NEXT]

[RESET]

If you win the first or second \S trick you will fail. When you attack ! Cs, East will win the \CA and play a \S.

Holding up twice can never hurt, and in this case it is the only way to make the contract.}

South plays 2\S. West leads the \C2. East plays the \CQ which you take with your \CA.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Count losers in the long-trump hand, (dummy this time).

You can make the contract if you just force out their big trumps. But there is another tempting possibility. You could enter dummy with the \DK and play the \H4, finessing East for the \HK. If the finesse is successful you could then discard dummy's \C loser on the \HA.

Should you or shouldn't you? [NEXT]

The reward for this play would be an overtrick. The price of failure would be going down in a cold contract. So obviously, at rubber bridge, you would be foolish to take such a risk. Playing Duplicate though, you might consider it. But let's say you decide to play safe. [NEXT]

Win the \CA and play a trump. As soon as you get in play another trump. The defenders will no doubt take their \C winner when they get in. East will no doubt win one of those high trump tricks, and he MAY lead a \H when he gets in. There you will be, trying to decide again whether to finesse . . .

As you see, the \HK is in the wrong place this time, but might be right the next time.

Usually you should not risk your contract for the sake of an overtrick.}

West leads \H5, East plays the \HQ.

The first thing you need to decide is whether to hold up on the \H.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

First decide the holdup question. West led the \H5 and you can see the \H4, \H3 and \H2. Assuming West led fourth down he must have only a 4-card suit since there are no cards he could have lower than the \H5. With ! Hs splitting 4-4 a holdup would do no good, and isn't necessary anyway.

So take the \HA. Then what? [NEXT]

You COULD try the \D finesse. Even if it loses it would establish several \D winners. However, if the defenders win just 1 \D trick they will quickly grab their 3 \H tricks and their \SA and put you down 1. [NEXT]

This is why it is important to make a Plan which includes a Winner count. You need just one additional winner and all you have to do to get it is play a \S honor.

When you can see all four hands, including the location of the \DQ, it kind of makes you wished you had finessed and gotten all those overtricks.

This looks so easy let's check it by trying a winner count as well. Five ! Ds (after \DA is gone), the \S A K, the \HA and the \C A K Q. Yes that adds up to 11 winners.

Is there ANY danger here at all? [NEXT]

Whenever a hand looks easy you should ask yourself what could go wrong. And here the only thing that could go wrong is if one of your \S winners gets ruffed. So how can you prevent that possibility? [NEXT]

If East has a singleton \S, and West has the \DA you might go down if you win the first trick in your hand. West will take his \DA and play the \SJ. If you go up with dummy's \SK East will ruff and you will still have a \S loser.

The simple solution is to win the first trick with dummy's \SK. Now when West wins the \DA and leads another \S it's a different situation. East may well ruff, but if he does you will just play a low card - East will have ruffed your \S LOSER.

Here's a suggestion - with fewer than 9 points and a 5-card Major transfer to that suit when you have a singleton, pass with no singleton. So here you bid 2\D and partner says 2\H. What do you bid now?

Of course you pass, that was the whole point of the transfer.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

In suit contracts it is usual to count losers. Sometimes in low level suit contracts it makes things clearer if you count winners. Here you have 4 high card winners in your hand plus the Ace of trumps in dummy.

Your plan will therefore be to make as many of dummy's small trumps as you can. [NEXT]

At trick 2 ruff a \S in dummy. Pull one trump with the \HA. Play a \C back to your \CA and ruff another \S. [NEXT]

Got the idea? Play a \D to your \DK and ruff your last \S in dummy. Then play the \DA. If you've been counting you have taken the first 8 tricks. A good thing, too, because you aren't going to take any more.

Partner's 3\C bid is Stayman; with 4 cards in both Majors you respond 3\H. Partner now bids 3NT.  What do you bid? 

Partner would not use Stayman unless he held a 4-card Major suit himself. Since he didn't like your ! Hs it follows that he must have 4 ! Ss.

So you correct the 3NT contract to 4\S. 

Click NEXT to continue. [NEXT]

If you had left it in 3NT you'd have 8 top tricks and a \S finesse for 9.

But you're in 4\S. Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

If you can guess the \SQ your problems are over. But just in case you dislike those 50% guesses, try to find a better Plan. [NEXT]

Another possibility is that a defender holds either a singleton or doubleton \SQ so you can pick up the suit by leading \S A K. This is smaller than a 50% chance. [NEXT]

But there is more to the odds than that. Suppose you try the second possibility and play off both the \SA and \SK but the \SQ does NOT drop. You are still not dead! You just leave the \SQ out there and start on ! Hs. As long as the defender who holds the \SQ has at least 3 ! Hs he will be unable to ruff until after you have discarded dummy's \D loser.

The extra chance makes this Plan your best hope.

Click NEXT to see which plan works. [NEXT]

You could have gone down easily by playing West for the \SQ.

Or you could have made it whoever held the \SQ by using the "improved" plan.}

Sometimes the opponents make overcalls which disrupt the smooth flow of your side's bidding. You and your partner need to have ways of dealing with these disruptions. One possibility is the lebensohl convention which is used a few times in these T0 Deals. There are lots of other methods out there, and you may not care for lebensohl. One of the big reasons we use it is that it includes a penalty double - some other methods use the double for other reasons.

So, in lebensohl an immediate double of their overcall of partner's 1NT opener is for penalties. Just like this one - punish them if they dare try to disrupt your bidding!

One trick is already lost and at first glance it looks like your only slim chance will be for the \D Q J to fall doubleton.

But a dummy has a very important card, the \H9. You know from the opening lead that West holds the \HT, so if he happens to hold the only guard in ! Ds you will be able to squeeze him in the red suits.  [NEXT]

You don't even have to do anything special. Play your 4 \C winners, then 3 \S winners. [NEXT]

Now play the \SJ and watch West's discard. If he throws the \HT dummy's \H9 will become a winner. If he doesn't throw the \HT then you know dummy's \H9 is worthless so discard it and hope the ! Ds are good.

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 3\H]

When partner opens 1NT, interference can easily gum up your smooth bidding sequences. Playing the lebensohl convention, your 3\H bid shows a 5-card suit and is forcing to game.

It doesn't always work out so well, but here partner had an easy 4\H bid.

Whatever you play, East takes the \S A K J and then plays a small \C. West started with just one \S.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Don't let that Question Mark by the \H losers mislead you - if you are going to make this contract you cannot lose a \H trick at all! Is there any hope? [NEXT]

The odds aren't good, but you actually have TWO possibilities for success. If West holds the singleton \HK, you can play a small \H to dummy's \HA, dropping the \HK, then finesse East out of his \HJ. Or, if East holds the singleton \HJ you can play your \HQ, finessing West for the \HK and at the same time smothering East's \HJ.

Which basket will you put your eggs into? [NEXT]

The answer is simple Bridge math! East started with 6 ! Ss leaving him 7 cards outside the \S suit. West started with just 1 \S, leaving him with 12 cards outside the \S suit. Obviously East is much more likely to have a singleton \H than West.

So you win the \CA in your hand, play the \HQ and let it ride if West does not cover.

Then you click NEXT to see how things turned out. [NEXT]

But to tell the truth, the Bridge math wasn't really complete. Distribution-wise it was just fine, but there is also the question of strength.

The fact that East overcalled makes it more likely that he holds more high cards than West, and this skews the odds toward East holding the \HK.

But think about it. If East does in fact hold the singleton \HK, and if you cleverly drop it by playing dummy's \HA it won't help you. You will then have to lose a trick to West's \HJ.}

You need one more winner. Although the \HK is a possibility, there is a real danger of losing 4 tricks in the suit if West holds the \HA.

A much better idea is to try to establish a \C trick, a suit where you hold 8 cards. [NEXT]

You must give up one \C trick in order to establish a winner there. It is important that you give up that \C trick to West. East is the Danger hand because if he wins a \C he might lead through your precarious \HK. So win the first trick, enter dummy with a \S honor, and play a small \C, finessing the \C9 when East plays low.  [NEXT]

West wins the \CJ, but you win the game. West cannot profitably play ! Hs, so he will probably continue with another \D. But since the \CQ will now drop under the \C A K you have your ninth trick.

South plays 3NT. West leads the \H6.

First big decision. Which \H do you play from dummy?

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

The Rule of Eleven tells you there are 5 ! Hs in North, East and South which are higher than the \H6. You and dummy hold 4 of them so you can place East with just 1. The missing high cards are \H A J T 9. Elementary, Watson; East must hold the \HT because from \H A J T 6, \H A T 9 6 or \H J T 9 6 West would NOT have led the \H6. So your first smart move is to play dummy's \HQ, which holds the trick. What next? [NEXT]

You need to find one more winner and your best chance is the \C suit. You will need a 3-2 split in the suit, but you must establish the \C winner without letting East get the lead. East is the Danger Hand because he can play a \H throughyour \H K 7. Therefore it would be unwise to play \CA, \CK, then another \C because East is very likely to be the one with 3 ! Cs. [NEXT]

Did you get it? Play a small \C toward your hand and put on the \CT if East plays low. You don't expect the \CT to win the trick, it is more of a duck than a finesse. West takes this with his \CJ but he can do you no harm. If he continues with ! Hs your \HK will be a second stopper. If he plays any other suit you will scamper home with your 9 tricks, which of course now include those 3 ! Cs.

Click NEXT to see the full deal. [NEXT]

But what if East had figured out what you were going to try and played his \CQ when you led from dummy?

He would have been very, very sorry. You would have had no choice but to win the trick, and when West's \CJ fell on the next trick you would have all 4 \C tricks!}

South plays 3NT. West leads the \S6; East plays the \SJ.

Your immediate problem is whether or not to hold up. ? ? ?

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

There is some merit in a holdup. East is likely to have just 2 ! Ss, so a holdup would exhaust his cards in the suit. If he later got the lead he would have no ! Ss. On the other hand, East might well switch to ! Cs, and that would certainly be unwelcome. Finally, if you do win the first \S you have another stopper if you can prevent East from getting the lead. So win the first trick with the \SK. Notice that by winning with the \SK you keep West in the dark as to whether you or East has the \SQ.

You need just one more trick, and either red suit might split 3-3. So is that your plan? Lead out red winners and hope? [NEXT]

Truthfully, that wouldn't be a terrible plan. The chance of a 3-3 split in a suit is about 36%. But since you need either of two 36% chances that comes to almost 60% (if you aren't Math oriented don't worry about it, you can trust me).

There's a safer approach though; remember you only need 4 \D tricks, not 5. [NEXT]

There is a wonderful "safety play" that will practically guarantee your contract. Enter dummy with a \H, then play a small \D toward your hand and finesse with your \DT! West may win with the \DJ, but even if he does he is the Safe Hand and cannot play a \S without giving you a trick. And whatever else he could play you would win and make 4 \D tricks. In the actual Deal the \D finesse actually works and you make all 5 tricks in the suit.

With both Majors, the correct response to Stayman is 2\H. Partner now bids 3NT. What do you say?

There are lots of possibilities for getting rid of one loser. The \SQ might drop, or she might be in the West hand, finessable. The ! Hs might split 3-3, providing for the discard of a \D loser. West might hold the \DQ so that finesse works. 

Suppose you win the \H in your hand and try the \S finesse. If East has the \SQ you will then have to find the ! Hs splitting, which is not likely, or the \DQ in the West hand. [NEXT]

A better plan would be to shun the trump Queen finesse entirely. Play the \SK, then \SA. If the \SQ falls then pull the last trump and you are home free.

If the \SQ DOESN'T fall, play your other two \H winners. When East discards on the last \H you exit with a small trump to a defender's \SQ.  [NEXT]

If West wins the \S you will just have to depend on the \D finesse. But if East takes the trick he will be endplayed, having to give you a ruff/sluff in ! Cs, or lead into dummy's \D K J.

South plays 3NT. West leads the \ST. You cross your fingers and put on dummy's \SJ. No good, East covers with the \SQ and you are forced to take your \SK at the first trick.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Not only do you need 3 more winners, you need to get them without losing the lead because the instant you lose the lead West will take all his \S winners. You can HOPE that will only be 3 of them but you can't depend on it.

The \C suit is your only hope. If East holds the \CK you can finesse him out of it. However, if he has \C K x x and refuses to cover your \CJ, you will have to have a second entry to dummy to cash the good ! Cs. [NEXT]

As it happens, you do have two entries, the \HA and \HQ! You just have to sacrifice your \HK to use them both. At trick 2 play your small \H to the \HQ. Play the \CJ, letting it ride when East plays low. Play a small \C to your \CQ. Play the \CA, dropping East's \CK. And finally, play your \HK to dummy's \HA so you can enjoy cashing those two good ! Cs.

Partner has about 11 points and he has no 4-card Major suit.

He thinks 3NT would be a good spot. You have no reason to disagree so you pass.

Click NEXT to continue. [NEXT]

East plays the \HJ and you duck, hoping he will switch to any other suit! But of course he doesn't; he continues with the \H4.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

You need three more winners. You can get them in ! Cs by just driving out the \CA. The danger is that EW might win the \CA and 4 \H tricks. Or, you can get them in ! Ss if East holds the \SK, a 50% chance. [NEXT]

You should try to avoid 50% chances when you have something better. Consider the chance that EW will actually be able to win 4 \H tricks if you give them the lead with the \CA. In particular notice that you were dealt the \H2! If West's \H3 is a fourth down lead then he cannot have anything smaller and the ! Hs are splitting 4-4.

Knowing they can only take 3 \H tricks makes it safe for you to drive out the \CA. [NEXT]

So win the \HA and drive out the \CA. They will take their 2 \H tricks next. If East then leads a \S DO NOT FINESSE. Take your nine tricks and run.

The loser count is very confused, but that \C suit is not confused at all. You want to be able to run the ! Cs so your plan is to play the \H A K, and if both defenders follow go ahead and knock out the last \H so they can't ruff your \C tricks.

Unfortunately when you play \H A K, West plays the \HQ, then discards a \S. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:DT]

You may think you should change your plan but you should go right ahead with it. East has two master trumps, but dummy still has 4 small ones. So play a \H to force out East's \HT. He will no doubt play another \S and force dummy to ruff. No problem, knock out East's final \H and dummy will still have one tiny trump left. When you get back in you can run the ! Cs unimpeded.

West leads the \HJ.

You play dummy's \HQ hopefully, but East plays the \HK.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

That is one loser too many. The \CQ MIGHT drop . . . but she won't. There are no finesse positions. So you are going to have to establish a winner somewhere to discard dummy's small \S. [NEXT]

Do you see it? The \H8. Take the \HA. Then play your \C A K. As predicted, the \CQ doesn't fall. Then play a small \H to dummy's \H9. Of course West will take the \HT, but now your \H8 is high.

As soon as you get the lead you play the \H8 and discard dummy's \S2.

The real reason for covering was so you could establish the \H8 by force.

Suppose you had not played the \HQ to trick one. East would have withheld the \HK and you'd have had to take your \HA. Later East would have taken dummy's \HQ with his \HK, then played a small \H through your \H8 to West's \H T 7.}

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

There are two obvious possibilities for avoiding the \H loser. You could finesse East for the \HK; this is a 50% chance. The ! Ds could split 3-3; this is a 36% chance.

In fact, your chances are better than either of those percentages because you can try the ! Ds first, and if they DON'T split you can then try the \H finesse. [NEXT]

Pull trumps; West shows up with 3 trumps. Play the \DK, then a small \D to dummy's \DA. On this trick West follows with the \DT.  [NEXT]

Your contract just became a sure thing! Play the \CK to strip both your hands of ! Cs. Lead dummy's last \D,  and when East plays low, finesse the \D9. If the finesse wins, discard a \H from dummy on your good \D. But if the finesse loses to West's \DJ, he will be endplayed and have to lead a \H into your \H A Q or give you a ruff/sluff with a \C.

You need two more winners. Barring a 4-0 \C split your two extra winners will be the \C5 and \C3.

So after winning the \HA, you play a \C to dummy's \CQ and breathe a sigh of relief when both defenders follow suit. [NEXT]

UhOh. Surely you didn't play your \C4 to dummy's \CQ???

If you did then just look at the situation now. If the \CJ doesn't fall on the next trick the suit will be blocked. Now go back in time and play the \CT to dummy's \CQ. [NEXT]

That's better. Now under the \C A K you can unblock the \C 9 7, which will leave you with the \C4 to slip under dummy's \C5.

Those losers are based on dummy's hand, not yours. You can figure them either way but it is usually easier to determine losers based on the long-trump hand. It's important to remember it in this Deal because the zero losers in ! Hs assumes you will ruff a \H in your hand. [NEXT]

Pull one round of trumps with dummy's \SK. Both defenders follow suit. Play the \HA, then \H6 to dummy's \HK. On this trick West follows with the \HT.  [NEXT]

Fortunately your ! Ds are solid and you do not need the \HQ as a winner.

So before playing any trumps play \H A K, discarding dummy's \CK. That's a lot of winners you are wasting but you can afford it.  [NEXT]

You may think it is a guess whether to play the \CK or \CJ, but there is no guessing involved here. You must play the \CJ because East cannot possibly hold the \CA. Just go back and look at the bidding again. The East hand failed to open the bidding in first seat. And since then you have seen the \H A K and the \SQ come out of the hand.

Two chances are always better than one. The way to take both chances is to duck a \D at trick 2. Win whatever the defenders play next and then test the ! Ds. If they do split your last \D will be trick #12. But if they don't split you can still try the \S finesse.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Don't worry any more about the ! Ds since there is nothing more you can do. Instead, worry about where that one more winner is going to come from. The answer will have to be: <i>from the \H suit</i>. [NEXT]

You might be tempted to take your 4 \C tricks right away, but avoid the temptation. The \C suit is your convenient transportation back and forth between hands.

You will have to lose at least 2 \H tricks in order to set up 1 winner, and by the time you do that the defenders will have established at least 1 more \D trick. What that means is that you cannot afford 3 \H losers. So how will you play the ! Hs? [NEXT]

You should play West for the \HJ plus one of the big ones. This is a better chance than playing him for both the \H A K. So play a \H toward dummy and insert the \HT when West plays low.

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 4\H]

You would really like to have a transfer bid in this situation, to make North bid ! Hs.

But you don't have one, so you just bid 4\H yourself.

Click NEXT to continue. [NEXT]

You play low in dummy and West holds the trick. He continues the suit and East takes the \SQ and then plays the \SA.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

You've already lost the 2 ! Ss. If West has the \HK you might avoid a loser there. You don't have a winner on which to discard the \C loser. [NEXT]

If East has the \HK it will have to be a singleton to help you, so it is more logical to play West for the \HK.  But if West does have the \HK it will do you no good to ruff East's \SA, West will over-ruff and you would still have that \C loser. [NEXT]

So do it this way instead. Discard the \C loser on East's \SA! Another \S from East won't hurt you since dummy would be able to over-ruff West. Whatever East plays you can win, then finesse West out of his \HK.

That was true, so instead you were able to discard it on a loser! }

With 20 HCP and balanced distribution you should open 2NT. Do not let the good 4-card \S suit sway you to anything else. Partner bids 3NT and everybody passes.

Click NEXT to continue. [NEXT]

You try the \HQ, but East plays the \HK.

You need 3 more winners and at least 2 of them must come from ! Ss. Furthermore you don't want East to lead ! Cs through your King. Your best hope is that East holds the \SK so you can finesse.  [NEXT]

So you win the \HA and start thinking about dummy entries. Your obvious entries are the \DK and \DJ. If East holds only two small ! Ss with his \SK, then two entries will be enough. But what if East holds \S K x x x ? Can you find a third entry to dummy? [NEXT]

If the ! Ds split 3-2 the answer is YES. Play the \DA, then lead your \D8 to dummy's \DJ. Watch carefully to see if both defenders follow to this trick. They do. Play a \S to your \ST, which holds the trick. Play your \DQ to dummy's \DK. Finesse the \S again. Return to dummy by playing your \D5 to dummy's \D6, then finesse the \S one last time.

You need 3 more tricks, obviously coming from the \C suit.

But the burning question right now is what do you do at trick one. Do you win or hold up? [NEXT]

You should assume that West holds the \SK.

If you take the \SA right now your \S J 5 will provide a second stopper if it is West who gets the lead. However, if East gets the lead he will play through your holding and you may lose 4 \S tricks.

If you hold up you can expect East to play another \S through your \S A J and West will then establish the suit. However, in doing so he will remove any \S held by East.

The answer key lies in the \C suit. You will be finessing through West, so East is the only defender who can get the lead in ! Cs. Therefore you must hold up on ! Ss until the third round.

Partner's 3\D bid shows a 5-card suit and is forcing to game. While 5\D is possibly the best contract your double \H stopper should sway you to 3NT instead. This is the old "9 tricks are easier than 11" principle.

Click NEXT to continue. [NEXT]

As expected, West attacks in his \H suit.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Even if East holds both black Queens, (not likely), you can only finesse your way to 8 tricks. Since you need 9 tricks you must establish the \D suit.

If West holds both the \DA and \DK then you are going down, because they will win the race to establish ! Hs before you can establish ! Ds. [NEXT]

But when the \DA and \DK are in different hands you have a good chance for success; it depends on East having no \H at the time he takes his \D winner. [NEXT]

So you should hold up on the first \H trick and win the second. If West started with 6 ! Hs then East will be out. So whether he wins his \D trick first or second he still won't be able to continue ! Hs.

On the other hand, if West takes the first \D trick he can certainly drive out your last \H stopper. But then, when East takes HIS \D winner he will have no \H.

Finally, if West had only a 5-card \H suit, good defense would beat you. But they have to be sure East wins the first \D trick, and they might slip up. }

South plays 3NT. West leads the \S3. Your first problem is which \S to play from dummy. That is an easy problem. If you play the \SK you might lose the first five or six tricks.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

You need 2 more winners, and you need to get them before you lose the lead because it appears that West can cash 3 more \S tricks.

That means you need all 5 \D tricks. The good news is that the 5 missing ! Ds will split 3-2 about two-thirds of the time. The bad news is that they will be 4-1 about one-third of the time. Can you protect yourself against a 4-1 break? [NEXT]

Maybe and maybe not. If West has \D J x x x there won't be anything you can do about it. But if East has this holding then you can succeed if you play your cards right. [NEXT]

<i>Did you like that "play your cards right" quip?</i>First play a \D to your \DK; both defenders follow. Next play a \D to dummy's \DQ. West discards a \C. You are conveniently in dummy so you play dummy's last \D and East's \D J 9 are caught in a pincer movement by your \D A T 5.

Suppose your first \D play had been dummy's \DQ. You could make your contract if you play a small \D and finesse the \DT. But at that point you wouldn't know whether the !

By taking the SECOND \D trick with dummy's \DQ the 4-1 split is exposed at the right time.}

Now you are desperate. You need two entries to dummy, one so you can play ! Hs to force out the \HQ, and another to enjoy the good ! Hs. One of these entries will be the \CK and the second will have to be the \CJ. So you play a \C to the Jack and then you . . .

Your chances for success are slipping away and you are down to your last hope. Your \SJ is a threat that only West can guard against. If West also is the defender with long !

So what are you going to discard right now on that \HJ? It looks obvious to discard the \DQ; then if the ! Cs do split 3-2 (68% chance) you will be home free, losing only two ! Hs and one\C. [NEXT]

Throwing the \DQ is a bad idea. And basically unnecessary. If the ! Cs are splitting 3-2 you don't need to keep a fourth \C in both hands. So discard a small \C from dummy and keep the \DQ just in case the ! Cs turn out 4-1 and you have to fall back on the \D finesse.

If East has both black Aces you will go down, but you know that he cannot have two outside Aces with a 6-card \H suit headed by the Q J and still open with a weak 2-bid. So West must have at least one of the black Aces. [NEXT]

If you could guess which Ace East holds you could work on that suit first. He would win it, then get his ! Hs established, but wouldn't be able to get back in to cash them.

But better than guessing, you should just holdup on the first \H trick and win the next one. Then it won't matter which Ace you knock out first because West will not have a \H to play in either case.

The contract would be 3NT played by North.

South plays 3NT. West leads the \HQ. You must make an immediate decision whether to hold up or not.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Of course the \C suit will produce 4 winners so you need just one more in ! Ss or ! Ds.

First the question of holding up or not. The reason for a hold-up play is to be sure that when East gains the lead he has no ! Hs remaining. But in this Deal you can place most of the strength with West so you don't need to hold up. And, in fact, there is a good reason why you shouldn't. [NEXT]

Win the first trick with your \HK and immediately play a \C, taken by West's \CA. He plays the \HJ which you win with your \HA. East followed suit to the second \H! [NEXT]

West has 3 \H winners in his hand. There is a good chance that he has the \SK and \DK as well. So if you play either of those suits, leading toward the Queen, West will jump up with his King and put you down 1. So instead, play a \C winner, and when West shows out, play your last \H! West will smile as he takes his three \H winners but then he will frown when he realizes he must lead away from one of his Kings! You, of course, will jump up with dummy's Queen of that suit for your ninth trick.

Click for the full deal. [NEXT]

[RESET]

Always keep in the back of your mind the possibility of an elimination play. In this Deal that meant you needed to refuse the hold-up because you would need the third \H to throw West in with.}

Partner's 2\H bid is a transfer; you respond 2\S. Partner now bids 3\S.  What do you bid? 

You wouldn't have chosen ! Ss for a trump suit.

Things look simple. You can afford one \S loser so as long as they split 3-2 you will succeed. So you play \SA, \SK; West follows to the first and discards a \D on the second. [NEXT]

OK, East has two trump tricks, but don't give up. Maybe, just maybe, there is a way out. Check your winners:You have won 3 tricks - \HA and \S A K. You have 4 more top winners - \DA and \C A K Q. If you can somehow add 3 more small trumps that will be the T you need. [NEXT]

Play dummy's \D7 to your \DA, then ruff a \D. Play a \C to your hand and ruff another \D. Play another \C to your hand and ruff your last \D. While you are ruffing these three ! Ds East is helplessly following suit.

Now play to your good \C while East again has to follow suit.

You have taken the first T tricks. Poor East is going to end up ruffing his partner's \D winner with one of his master trumps.

South plays 6NT. West leads the \DT. Too bad West didn't lead a \S. Oh, well.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

There is no way to get more than 4 winners in each minor suit, so you need to win either the \SJ or \HQ.

Which one should you try? [NEXT]

Why not try both? If you make sure you try them in the right order you can have both chances. [NEXT]

Suppose you lead a small \S from dummy and play your \SJ, and it loses to West's \SQ. If you then try leading a small \H toward dummy's \HQ, obviously the defender with the \HK will grab it to set the contract.

Instead, try the effect of leading toward the \HQ first. If West has the \HK then you will succeed in creating the extra winner you need. But what if you play the \HQ and East takes it with his \HK? Too bad, but at least you are not dead yet. You still have a chance to finesse  East for the \SQ.

Click for the full deal. [NEXT]

[RESET]

There are two critical cards, the \SQ and the \HK. However they are not the same degree of criticality.

If the \SQ is in a favorable position, (with East), you are always going to make your contract no matter which you try first.

But if only the \HK is in a favorable position, (with West), you can make the contract only if you try ! Hs first.}

I hope you didn't continue drawing trumps by playing the \HK. If you did then you are going down in an ice-cold contract.

That is definitely NOT what you should do. West led the \S5, then played the \S3 to the second trick. You have seen the \S4 and \S2 so it is clear that West started with a 5-card suit. That means East still has a \S. The instant you play a \D one of the defenders will grab the \DA and West will take his three more \S tricks.

It won't work. You would establish the \D for your last discard but you have no entry to it. [NEXT]

This will work. At trick 2 discard the \DA on dummy's \SK. Play the \DQ and discard a \C when East doesn't cover. West will take the \DK and attack ! Cs but you are in control now. You win your \CA, pull trumps, ending in dummy, and discard the remaining 2 \C losers on dummy's \D J T.

If East held the \DK the play would be slightly different; you would have to ruff when he covered. But the result would be the same.

First decide about what to do at trick #1. If you hold up and West plays another \D, no harm will be done. But probably no good will be done either because West is likely to have 6 ! Ds, leaving East with just a singleton anyway. But what if West pockets the one \D trick and switches to ! Hs, a suit where you only have one stopper? Since that might turn out badly, you should NOT hold up.

As to which hand to win it in, that's easy. You need to preserve any dummy entries that you can so you win the first trick with your \DK. [NEXT]

Now you establish some \C winners. You play the \CJ and both defenders play low. [NEXT]

You have to assume that defenders good enough to hold up their \CA at the first opportunity will be good enough to do it on the second play also. But you can thwart them by next playing your \CT and overtaking with dummy's \CQ. Even if they do hold up again you can continue with another \C from dummy to establish the suit while you still have the \DA for an entry.

Is it a 50-50 guess? Or is East more likely to have the \CQ since he had the opening hand? [NEXT]

No, it is not a 50-50 guess. No, East doesn't have the \CQ, West does. If you watched the cards that East has played you will realize he started with 3-3-4-3 distribution.

It's not as bad as that Winner List looks; you can establish 4 \S winners very easily.

Maybe you can and maybe you can't. It depends on what you played from your hand at the first trick. If you won that trick in your hand with the \HA, then YES, you can get to dummy by leading twice toward the \H Q J.

But if you won the first trick more cheaply with your \HT, (or perhaps dummy's \HJ), and you still have that \HA in your hand then West will prevent you from ever getting to dummy.

Suppose you win the first trick with your \HT. If you later play your \HA then West's \HK will stop you from getting to dummy. But if instead you play a small \H toward the \H Q J West will grab his \HK and your own \HA will block your entry.

But if you take the first trick with a "spendthrift" \HA then dummy's \H Q J will become a guaranteed entry to the ! Ss.

And notice - no matter which way you play it you still end up with exactly 2 \H tricks. So the play doesn't cost a trick, it just gains an entry.}

For the elimination play to work you must strip ! Ds from both hands. So play both the \D A K, then ruff a \D with the \SQ. Pull trumps with your \S A J, then ruff the last \D in dummy.

The work is done. Just play a \H. Whichever defender wins must either play a \C into your split tenaces, or play a red card and give you a ruff/sluff.

South plays 3NT. West leads the \C2 and East plays the \CJ.

Question 1: Do you hold up?

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

The lead of the \C2 tells you that West has only a 4-card suit, so there is no need to hold up. In fact if you did hold up East might play an unwelcome \H back.

Your best bet is going to be the \D suit, but dummy isn't exactly loaded with entries. How will you manage it? [NEXT]

When entries are really scarce the best approach is ducking. Win the \CK and play a low \D from both hands. A defender will win this and probably continue with a \C. [NEXT]

Stick to the plan. Win the \CA and again play small ! Ds from both hands, relaxing when both defenders follow suit to the second \D.

They can now cash their 2 ! Cs, and you had to give them 2 ! Ds. But that's the only tricks they will get. Dummy's 3 ! Ds are good and you still have a \D in your hand to get there.

You know there are enough points for slam, but not enough for a Grand Slam. Asking for Aces will get you nowhere because if partner shows only one Ace you will still think you should be in slam.

The Losers are counted from dummy's long-trump hand for simplicity.

The \C suit must be established to take one of the \D losers. But there may be an entry problem since the opening lead has taken out one of your entries already.

Pull trumps in two rounds, (you got a break there), leaving the \SK in your hand as an entry. [NEXT]

If you now play \CA, \CK, and then ruff a \C you will succeed when the ! Cs split 3-3. But if they are 4-2, then you will fail because you only have the one entry to your hand. [NEXT]

A better plan is to play a small \C from each hand. This gives the defense a \C trick but you can win their return, play a \C to the \C A, take the \CK, then ruff the FOURTH \C. This will establish the FIFTH \C and you still have the \SK for an entry.

Click NEXT to see the full deal. [NEXT]

[RESET]

If you can afford to lose a trick in the suit you can make do with one fewer entry just by ducking the first round. Basically it gives you three plays in the suit before you take your ruff. 

But what if the contract had been 7\S?

Obviously you couldn't afford to lose a trick so you would have to bang down the two top ! Cs, then ruff one and hope the suit was splitting 3-3.}

South plays 3NT. West leads the \DK. What will you play from dummy? (East follows with the \D2.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Since West has apparently led from \D K Q it seems you will get a second \D winner when they pursue the suit. You can also establish 3 more winners in ! Cs. You can also establish 3 more winners in ! Ss.

But as you can figure, you are going to have to establish BOTH black suits to get enough winners, and therein lies the problem. If West has a 5-card \D suit they will be able to establish 3 \D winners by the time you have knocked out both black Aces. In that case you cannot make the contract. Of course, if the ! Ds are split 4-4 you will only lose 2 ! Ds and the two black Aces. However West would probably not have overcalled a 4-card suit. [NEXT]

But West might have a 6-card \D suit, leaving East with just 2. Assume the two black Aces are split, one with West and one with East. If you win the first trick with dummy's \DA you will be OK if you first play the black suit where West holds the Ace. He will take it and then establish his ! Ds. No problem, because when you knock out East's black Ace he won't have a \D left. BUT, if you guess the wrong black suit first you will go down.

You can protect your interests fully just by letting West hold the first \D, then winning the second as cheaply as you can. At that point East will be out of ! Ds so it won't matter which black suit you go for.

Click NEXT to see the full deal. [NEXT]

[RESET]

If you take dummy's \DA at the first trick you will succeed if you next attack ! Ss, but you will fail if you next attack ! Cs. 

But if you hold up on the first trick and win the continuation, you will succeed whichever black suit you attack next.

The holdup would of course fail if West held both black Aces, but in this case no Plan would succeed.}

Partner's 2NT bid invites you to bid game if you have a maximum hand. With 17 points you bid the game.

Click NEXT to continue. [NEXT]

You play the \C4 from dummy, East plays the \CT and you take your \CQ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

You are pretty sure West has the \CA so dummy's \CK can become a winner. If so, you only need 3 more winners.

All 3 can come from the \D suit if the finesse works, only 2 if it fails. Assume the worst, so that means you will also need a \S winner. [NEXT]

When you give up the lead the opponents are going to continue ! Cs if they can. If West has a 5-card \C suit you could lose 3 ! Cs, the \SA and the \DK. Either defender might win the \SA, but only East can win with the \DK.  [NEXT]

Since West, the Danger hand, can only get in with the \SA you should establish a \S winner first, even though the ! Ds are better. Whoever wins the \SA will probably knock out dummy's \CK. Hopefully this will not cause you a problem because when your finesse for the \DK loses to East he won't have another \C. At least that's the Plan!

Click NEXT to see if the Plan was a good one. [NEXT]

Play ! Ss first and even though West can win and establish ! Cs East will not have a \C to return when he wins his \DK.

There are two chances for your thirteenth winner, your fourth \C or dummy's fourth \D.

Some players will assume that means one of those two suits will have to split 3-3, so they will immediately test one, then the other. [NEXT]

In fact there is another possibility for success - even if neither suit is 3-3 it may be that the same defender holds 4 cards in both suits. In this case that defender can be squeezed. BUT, you don't play the ! Cs and ! Ds first, you play the other two suits.

Win the first \H, then play two more ! Hs and all three \S winners. That will be 6 tricks played, and each defender will be down to 7 cards left in their hand. If one of them happened to start with 4 ! Cs and 4 ! Ds he will have to discard from one of the holdings and you will be able to win your fourth card in that suit.

South plays 2\S. West leads the \HQ and East plays the \H9.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Suppose you win the \HA, play over to the \CQ, then try to get back to your hand with a trump to discard 2 losers on \C A K. If it worked that way it would be fine, but it is very likely that a defender would win their trump Ace, then take their 2 ! Hs and 3 ! Ds. You could be down one before you even got started.

A better approach is to trade one of your \C winners for a quick discard. Take the \HA, then play  \C A K, discarding a \H from dummy. That will eliminate one \H loser. [NEXT]

You probably cannot avoid your 3 \D losers, but you may be able to get out with losing a single trump. IF ! Ss split 3-2, and IF you can win tricks with both the \SK and \SQ then you will make it. The only way it can happen is if East holds a doubleton \S A x. You must play the first \S from dummy, so ruff a \C to get there, then lead a small \S, putting on your \SQ when East follows low. This wins the trick, (hip-hip), so you now play your \S3, ducking in dummy. When East has to take his \SA, (hooray), you are home-free.

Click NEXT to see the full deal. [NEXT]

[RESET]

But, if you need East to hold the \S A x anyway, perhaps that first plan would have worked better. You know, take dummy's \CQ, then play a low \S to get to your hand. 

It depends on East. If he ducked the low \S then you could get TWO discards and make an overtrick.

The method given here gives up the possibility of an overtrick for an improved chance of making the contract. You choose.}

South plays 6\H. West leads the \S8. To play the \SA or not to play the \SA, that is the question.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

At first thought it seems the \S lead has saved you a guess in the suit. By playing low in dummy you will force East to put on the King, (if he has it), winning the trick but leaving you with a pretty good position in ! Ss. [NEXT]

That's why it's good to have second thoughts at the Bridge table. Think about the meaning of the \S8 lead. If it is fourth down, then the Rule of 11 tells you that there will be 3 cards higher than the 8 spread among North, East, and South. BUT YOU CAN SEE 4 HIGHER CARDS. So your conclusion is that West has NOT made a fourth-down lead, but rather has led top-of-nothing, top-of-a-doubleton, or perhaps a singleton.

You don't know which of the above, but you do know that East holds both the \S K J. The danger is if the \S8 is a singleton and you play low from dummy they could get a \S trick and a \S ruff. So don't play low from dummy. Win the \SA at trick 1, pull trumps and then play ! Ss from dummy toward your \S Q T 9, giving East the \SK but finessing him out of his known \SJ.

Click NEXT to see the full deal. [NEXT]

[RESET]

If East led the \S8 from \S 8 6 or \S 8 2 then it also wouldn't matter whether you played the \SA or not, you would always make the contract.

If East led the singleton \S8 then you had better play the \SA or you will be down before you start.

It is unlikely that East would lead the \S8 from any holding containing one or both of the honors.}

Partner jumps to 3\H. Now what do you bid? You might just go ahead and bid 6\H. Partner probably has at least two Aces for his strong bidding. The other choice is a Blackwood 4NT, and this is certainly not the type of hand where asking for Aces is always helpful - what if partner shows two Aces, aren't you going to bid the slam anyway? The advantage to Blackwood here is that there is just a slim possibility that partner has only one Ace! You bid 4NT and partner replies 5\S. Next? Three Aces. You still should stop at 6\H, based on points.

The \S loser is deceptive. You could discard a \S from dummy on your \DA, but would still have a \S loser if the finesse doesn't work. Still, this would be one possible plan. Can you improve on that? [NEXT]

Maybe you can. Look harder at the ! Ds. Win the \CA, then play to dummy's \DK. Pull trumps (2 rounds) ending in your hand. Play your \DA, but discard a \C from dummy, (the key play). Now play your \DJ, and if West plays low, discard dummy's other \C.

You have gotten rid of the \C losers, but if East can win the \DQ on this trick you will discard a \S on the \DT, but will still have to try the \S finesse.

But, if the \DJ holds then it won't matter if the \S finesse works or not, you will make the slam.

No problem. You ruff in dummy, come back to your hand with a trump and THEN discard dummy's last \C on your \DT.

South plays 1NT. West leads the \HJ and East plays the \H8. Do you hold up? If so, how many times?

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

It probably makes no difference whether you hold up or not since East surely has most of the high cards. However, holding up once is a good idea because West may have a singleton \H and have to switch to something which helps you. West holds the first trick and plays another \H, which you win. [NEXT]

You must find 4 winners. The bad news is that you must finesse both the \DK and the \SQ. The good news is that with East opening the bidding there is a good chance he has both of them. So, how will you manage those two finesses? [NEXT]

There is only one way to do it. Enter dummy with the only entry, the \SK. Take the \D finesse first - play the \DQ and unblock your \DJ when East plays low. (you could play the \DT/\D7 combination first). [NEXT]

Finesse the \D again. If East ducks a second time you must now take the \S finesse while you are still in dummy. If East covers the second \D you win with your \DA, return to dummy with the \D9, and then finesse the \S.

West's \HQ lead presents you with an immediate decision (or two) to make.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

You need 4 additional winners and can only establish 3 of them in ! Ds. So you will have to manufacture another one from the \C suit as well. If you assume the \C finesse will fail, (and you have probably noticed that most finesses DO fail on these pages), that means you will lose the lead twice.

So what do you do about that \HQ? Do you win or hold up? [NEXT]

You hold up, of course, to cut defensive communications when West has 5 ! Hs and East has 3. West will probably play another \H to dummy's \HK. [NEXT]

If both the \DA and \CK are in West's hand then you won't make this contract. He will easily establish his ! Hs and have an entry to get in and cash them. If the \DA is with West and the \CK is with East then it doesn't matter in which order you play the suits since you will not lose the lead in ! Cs. But if the \CK is with West and the \DA is with East then it is vital that you play ! Cs first.

The two \C losers can be ruffed in dummy. A successful \H finesse could save you a loser in trumps. So, should you take the \H finesse now? [NEXT]

No, because if you play \HA, then the \H finesse LOSES, East might play a third \H and stop you from your two ruffs in dummy. A much better plan is to play the \HK, then \HA, and if the \HQ drops, well and good. This time she doesn't, but both East and West follow to both trump leads. Play the \C A K, the \SK, and the \D A K Q.

If somebody ruffs any of these it will be with the master trump and you won't care. But if they don't ruff yet, you just start cross-ruffing ! Cs and ! Ss and let them ruff in whenever they like.

But that is only correct as far as that suit is concerned. When you look at the entire hand you may find that by taking your two high trumps and leaving the master Queen out you can make all four of your small ones separately.

Since your minor suit hopes require that BOTH of them work, your best bet is the double \S finesse. [NEXT]

You need just one more winner. It could come from a finesse of the \CJ. It could come from a 3-3 \H split. It could come by establishing a fourth card in ! Ds.

Most important for now is the \S lead? Do you hold up? [NEXT]

Yes you should hold up. In fact you might as well hold up twice since you aren't contemplating a throw-in of West. Holding up twice will protect you in the unlikely event that West made his 2\S bid with a 5-card suit. [NEXT]

Both the \H possibility and the \C possibility will either work or not, so you can save them for later. Your highest percentage chance is the fourth \D, but here you must be careful. You must try to establish the ! Ds without allowing West to get the lead. It is actually pretty easy. Just play a small \D from your hand and when West plays low insert the \DT. East wins the \DJ but cannot harm you with his return.

A holdup wouldn't hurt you since West would retain the lead. But it probably wouldn't help you much either since you do have 2 stoppers in the suit. You obviously need to establish at least one more winner in ! Ss so you won't have to depend on the \HA being with East. Need it be said that ! Hs is the suit you are worried about and East is the Danger hand? Let's say you win the first trick with dummy's \DK. [NEXT]

Suppose you play \SA, then \S K Q. If they split 3-3 you will be soooo happy because you will make at least T tricks. But if East shows out on the third \S you will be pretty happy because you can give up a \S to West and still make at least 9 tricks. But if West shows out on the third \S you could be in deep trouble. You would have to give East the lead to establish an extra \S winner, and he might very well lead through your \HK. [NEXT]

Partner's 2\H is a transfer, so you bid 2\S. Partner now bids 2NT. What do you say?

Partner is only inviting, so he must have either 9 or 10 points. And since he chose 2NT as the invitation he must have only 5 ! Ss. You will accept the invitation since you have a maximum 1NT opener, and you choose 3NT since you know there is no 8-card \S fit.

When West leads the \H5 you have an immediate decision to make.

It is pretty clear that the 4 additional winners you need will be ! Ss. The danger is that when you force out the \SA the defenders might be able to cash 4 ! Hs right away. So the immediate decision is whether you take the \HA on the first trick or wait until the second. [NEXT]

If West has only 4 ! Hs it will make no difference what you do because they will only win 3 \H tricks and you will make your contract. So assume that West has a 5-card suit, which means that East has 2 ! Hs. West's suit is definitely NOT \H K Q J 5 2; he would have started with the \HK, not the \H5. So you can be sure that East holds either \H K x, \H Q x or \H J x. So what? [NEXT]

So you should play the \HA immediately. If East puts on his small \H then his lone honor will block the suit the next time it is played. But if he unblocks the honor under dummy's \HA then your \H T 9 7 will be promoted into a second stopper.

You should not hold up on the \H for two reasons. First, East might have a singleton. Second, you might not have a \H loser at all (if you can discard both of dummy's \H losers on your ! Cs. 

So win the \HA and start on trumps by playing \SA, then \SK. Uh Oh. East discards a \H on the second \S so you have two \S losers. [NEXT]

Now you will have to be lucky. Leave the two master trumps undrawn and start running the ! Cs. Fortunately East has 4 ! Cs and you are able to discard both of dummy's \H losers. Play a \D next and your luck continues when it is West who takes the trick. Since East can't get in to pull your trumps, you cannot be defeated. You play your \D winners and ruff a \H in dummy. East will get his two trumps at the end.

Over an opponent's Weak 2-bid a 2NT overcall is used to show basically the same as a 1NT opening bid, but promising stopper(s) in their suit.

Partner bids 3NT.

Click NEXT to continue. [NEXT]

As expected, West leads his partner's \H suit.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

You need only one more winner; the best chance will be a 3-2 split in ! Cs. But if that doesn't happen you might have to try the finesse in either ! Ss or ! Ds. The problem is that both finesses go into the East hand. Because of that fact there is no reason to hold up on the first trick so you win the \HA. Then you play the \CA . . . and East discards a \D! [NEXT]

Don't be sad that the ! Cs didn't split, your contract is now guaranteed! Well, guaranteed as long as East has only a 6-card \H suit.

Play your \HK, and when West follows suit play your \H7. East wins this trick and he can also win 3 more \H tricks. But when he runs out of ! Hs he will be forced to play a \S or a \D because he doesn't have any ! Cs. Either one will give you your ninth trick.

Your ninth trick will be either the \SJ or the \DQ. In both cases the finesse would be into the West hand so the question of disrupting opponent's communications doesn't arise - East is not going to get the lead.

Nonetheless it is a good idea to hold up - but only once. [NEXT]

West then plays the \CQ which you win as East follows. Next you run four \H tricks, ending in dummy. You play dummy's \SK, your sixth trick so far. It is crunch time. Do you now finesse for the \DK or the \SQ? [NEXT]

The answer is NO, you do not take either finesse. Instead you play a \C, hoping West must take the trick. And he does. West then cashes two more \C tricks but then he is out of ! Cs. Since he is also out of ! Hs he is going to have to play either a \S or a \D, either one of which will make you very happy!

You count 3 \D tricks but will need to be careful to get all 3. And obviously your three extra winners will have to be from the \C suit.

Most important for now, how do you read the \H suit? Do you hold up? [NEXT]

West has 4 ! Hs because he led the \H3 and you can see the \H2. Therefore you should NOT hold up because they can only win 3 ! Hs and the \CK right now. But if you hold up, East might pocket his \H trick and switch to ! Ss, where you are just as bad off. [NEXT]

So win the \HA and unblock the \D A Q. then play \CJ, expecting to lose the trick. In fact, West takes his \CK.

West cashes his 3 \H tricks, then plays a \S. Pounce with dummy's \SA, cash the \DK, then take your 4 \C tricks and the game.

Without thinking it through you might decide to save that entry to dummy and win the first trick in your hand. But to get the 4 \D tricks you need you are going to have to make them play their \DA WITHOUT using one of your two honors. That means the \DA must be doubleton, AND you must lead through it. And EAST is the one most likely to hold \D A x. [NEXT]

You win dummy's \SK and play a low \D. When East follows with the \D3 you play your \DQ which wins.

You are certain that West has both red Kings for his opening bid, (you and dummy have 26 HCP between you so that only leaves 14). But you also know that West has at least 5 ! Ss, so if you lead toward a red Queen West will grab his red King plus 4 \S tricks.

Does that resolve the holdup question for you? [NEXT]

Yes. You hold up ONCE, and take the \SA at trick 2. Next you play \C K Q J to strip West of that suit. Then play the \ST to throw West into the lead.

He can take his other 3 \S winners, but after that he must lead a red card. Of course you confidently put up dummy's Queen which will be your ninth trick.

Click NEXT to see the full deal. [NEXT]

[RESET]

Here you couldn't afford to hold up twice because then you would not have a throw in card left to put West on lead. 

But you had to hold up on the first trick to make sure East couldn't gain entry in the suit.

By the way, if West had a 6-card suit this plan wouldn't work. But then, no other plan would either.}

The \S, \H and \C losers are inevitable so you'd better not lose a \D. Even though East has returned a \D it is still possible that he holds the \DK so the finesse has a chance of working. Let's say a 50% chance. Do you take it? [NEXT]

No, of course not. Not when you have a play that offers almost a T0% chance. Win the \DA, play \SK, \SA, then \H K Q, discarding dummy's 2 \D losers.  [NEXT]

With one master trump still out you start on the ! Cs, playing first the \CK, then overtake the \CJ with dummy's \CQ. The defense is welcome to take their \CA whenever they want, and they are also welcome to their trump trick. You are so gracious because you have your ten tricks!

No, don't hold up. At least you have ! Ss stopped twice, your other suits are stopped only once.

Realizing that your only hope is for a bunch of \C tricks you win the \SK and play the \CQ. West covers with the \CK. What do you do? [NEXT]

If you win with dummy's \CA, and if the ! Cs split 2-2, you can win 7 \C tricks and 4 other high cards. Wow! 

But if it turns out that the \CK was singleton you will win just TWO \C tricks because dummy has no other entries. [NEXT]

So if you feel like gambling, go up with the \CA. But if you like the idea of a guaranteed contract let West hold the \CK, and you make sure of the six other ! Cs.

South plays 4\S. West leads the \CK. Seeing T top tricks sort of makes you wish you had just bid 3NT.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Missing 5 ! Ss, the most likely split is 3-2, (68% of the time). You win the \CA and play a small \S toward dummy. West puts on the \SQ which you take with dummy's \SA, East following with the \S6.

Do you play ! Ss again? or not? [NEXT]

Not. With both defenders following suit, the possibility of 4 \S losers is gone so you can lose at most 3. But that \SQ from West is ominous. If you play another \S and they do split 3-2 you will make 11 tricks, losing only 2 trumps. But if East has 3 ! Ss left he will win the trick, pull all the rest of the trumps, and lead a \C to West.

The guaranteed way to make the contract is to play no more ! Ss, but to start playing \D winners. The defenders can make their 3 trump tricks but you maintain control of the hand.

Click NEXT to see the full deal. [NEXT]

[RESET]

But with a different distribution, (3-2), playing the second trump would have been great. 

Considering probabilities it looks like this. If you play the second trump you will make 2 overtricks about 70% of the time, but you will go down 4 about 30% of the time.

If you stop with the ! Ss and start running ! Ds you will make your contract T0% of the time but will never make an overtrick. }

OK, no 4-4 \S fit. But partner has at least 2\H so you know you have an 8-card (or better) fit there. With 10 points you have to decide whether to invite or insist, and you like the looks of this hand so you bid 4\H.

You don't expect a trump loser, and obviously you cannot afford to have one.

So after ruffing the third \C you play \HA, then \HQ. Aargh! West discards a \D on the second trump. [NEXT]

East has left the \H J 9 while you have the \H Q T 8. If only dummy had another \H you could finesse East's \HJ, but, alas, dummy has none. Can you see another way to accomplish the finesse? [NEXT]

If you could manage to be in dummy after trick 11, and have nothing in your hand but the \H Q T, while East had nothing in his hand but the \H J 9 you would have him. But to accomplish this you must use up your \H8 beforehand.

You enter dummy with a \D, then play a small \D and ruff with your \H8. Then play your \SK. West wins this and assume he plays another \S.  [NEXT]

Win the \S in dummy, then play \DK, and the other \S winner. If East has to follow to all these then you will have accomplished your objective; East will be down to \H J 9 and will have to ruff trick 12 with one of them - which you will over-ruff.

Click for the full layout. [NEXT]

When you played a third \D to ruff with your \H8, East COULD have ruffed this. If he had, it would have handed you your contract since you could over-ruff and take care of your trump problem immediately.

At first this looks like the classic King / Jack guess situation where you try to figure out if West is more likely to have the Ace or the Queen.

Usually it is a good idea to leave a master trump un-pulled and go about your business winning tricks in other suits. The idea is to force them to ruff without using any more of your trumps. But that is only "usually". Here your big source of winners is going to be the \C suit - and there are zero outside entries to it. Suppose you do not force out the \SQ, but start playing \C winners. A defender might ruff the third \C and you would be doomed.

So play one more \S and they are doomed.

Almost always the answer is "not to pull".

So the ! Ds won't be splitting and you need a different plan. [NEXT]

You need to get a \D discard somewhere, and dummy's third \S will take care of one of YOUR \D losers. But then to establish YOUR hand you are going to have to ruff all 3 \C losers. [NEXT]

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

If West has led from \S K T 9 x, then all you have to do to make this contract is play a low card from dummy. But a decent defender would not make such a risky lead against a 7NT contract, so it is probable that East has the \SK. You rise with the \SA.

You hope the ! Ds will split 3-3, but if they don't you still have the possibility of squeezing East if he holds 4 ! Ds along with the \SK you have assigned to him. [NEXT]

If it comes to a squeeze it is important to take your tricks in the correct order. First take 4 \C tricks, discarding the \SJ from your hand. You note that East discards a small \S on the fourth \C.

Next take 4 \H winners, discarding dummy's useless \S6 and keeping all 4 ! Ds. On the fourth \H East must come down to a 4-card holding; he must either throw his \SK, (you are happy) or he can throw one of his ! Ds, (you are happy). 

Click NEXT to see what a great squeezer you are. [NEXT]

That means you didn't have to do anything special, just play your winners in the right order and keep your eyes open to see if the \SK gets discarded.

*Don't get overconfident with this loser list. It assumes that trumps break 3-2, (if they don't you cannot make it), and also assumes you will be able to cross-ruff 4 small black cards.

Cross-ruffing those 4 losers could be a problem. You can't afford to get over-ruffed so it would be nice if you could pull some trumps before you start the cross-ruff. But you must make sure that only two rounds of trumps get pulled, otherwise you won't have the trumps for the cross-ruff. [NEXT]

It is actually simple to make sure exactly two rounds of trumps are drawn. At trick 2 just duck a \H in each hand. An opponent will win this, but you can take the next trick, (probably a \D), and then pull a second round of trumps with your \HA. Then leave the trumps alone and play your two black A K's, then start cross-ruffing with your 4 tiny trumps. The defender with the master trump can over-ruff when he can, and can even cash a \D. But that's all he can do so you will make your game.

East would have won the second one, and if he had then continued ! Ds you would have made the contract.  

But if he was a good enough defender to pull a THIRD round of trumps, getting 2 for the price of 1 value, you would have been defeated.}
