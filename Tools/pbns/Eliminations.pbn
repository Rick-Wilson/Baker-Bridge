North's 3\S bid is a limit raise showing T-12 points and good trump support. South is to play 6\S. West leads the \HQ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

With one certain \H loser you cannot afford to lose a \D also. You could guess which way to finesse and be correct half of the time. But an elimination play will work ALL of the time.

Win the first trick and play \SA, \SK. Trumps split 2-1.

[PLAY N:SK,N:S4,N:H4,S:SA,S:S3,S:HA]

Next play three rounds of \Cs to eliminate that suit from both your and dummy's hand.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:CK,N:C8,N:C2,S:CA,S:CQ,S:C5]

With all the eliminations completed you are ready for the throw-in. Lead a \H from either hand. One of the defenders will win, (you don't care which), and will be end-played.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:H6,S:H3]

The defender who won the last trick cannot lead a trump because he has none. If he leads a \H or a \C you will get a ruff-sluff, ruffing in one hand while discarding a \D loser from the other. If he leads a \D you will get the free finesse you were hoping for all along.

This should remind you a lot of Deal 1. This time you have 1 \H loser and 3 \D losers. If you can force the opponents to lead \Ds you can make a trick with the \DQ or \DJ, avoiding one of those losers.

Win the first trick and play \SA, \SK. Trumps split 2-1.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:H6,S:H3]

No matter which defender wins the \H he is end-played. A \H or a \C will give you a ruff-sluff, but if he leads a \D you cannot be prevented from establishing either your \DQ or \DJ as a winner.

This is another follow-up to Deal 1. But this time you are missing both the \DQ and \DJ. In this case an Elimination play doesn't give you a guarantee, it just improves your odds.

Win the first trick and play \SA, \SK. Trumps split 2-1.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

Play three rounds of \Cs to eliminate the suit from you and dummy.

[PLAY N:CQ,N:CJ,N:C8,S:CA,S:CK,S:C5]

Now execute the throw-in by leading a \H from either hand.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:H6,S:H3]

The defender who gets thrown in cannot play a \H or a \C without handing you the contract by way of a ruff-and-sluff. So he must lead a \D. Suppose it is West who leads the \D. You play low in dummy and East must play either the \DQ or \DJ to keep you from getting a cheap trick with your \D9. So you take East's honor with your \DA and then finesse West for the other honor. As long as the \DQ and \DJ are in different hands the elimination play will succeed.

By forcing them to start the \Ds you make three tricks when the two outstanding honors are divided. }

You still have two losers in the \H suit, so the question is which way you plan to finesse the \Cs. And of course the answer is that you don't plan to finesse them at all!

Pull trumps with the \SA, then \SK. Next ruff dummy's last \D.

North decides a limit raise is better than just jumping to game. South has heard enough and bids the slam. 

South is to play 6\S. West leads the \DQ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

So you win the \DK and play a \S to your \SK. When West discards a \D your second thought is probably that you MUST guess the \CQ just to make twelve tricks.

Hopefully your third thought is that if you use an elimination play you won't have to guess.

If West puts on either the \CT or \CJ you play dummy's \CQ. If East can win with the \CK he will once again be end-played, forced to either play a \C back to dummy's \CA 9, or give you a ruff-sluff.

South considered Blackwood, then realized if North showed either 2 or 3 Aces he was going to bid slam. But if North showed just one Ace he would have to maneuver to play 5NT which might be worse than 6\C. So he just bid the slam. South plays 6\C. West leads the \SJ.

Perhaps an elimination play will improve your chances. Don't lead a trump yet though, you're going to need several entries to dummy to eliminate the \Hs. 

Win the \S, play to the \HA and ruff a \H.

Play a trump to dummy's \CJ (both defenders follow) and ruff another \H high.

[PLAY N:HJ,N:CA,S:C6,S:C4]

Now execute the throw-in by leading a \S. If West wins the trick he will have to play \Ds for you or give you a ruff-sluff. So if these are competent defenders they will make sure that it is EAST who wins the \S trick. So he does, and he plays a small \D.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:S5,S:S4]

DO NOT PLAY THE JACK! If the finesse is going to work now it will still work one trick later. By playing low you take advantage of the possibility that East held the \DT and West will have to put on the \DQ to prevent you taking a trick with dummy's \D9.

Click to see the Deal. [NEXT]

Here you had two chances. First, West might have HAD to win the throw-in, either because he had all of the high \Ss, or more likely because he messed up. The second chance paid off when East took the throw-in but you found a fortunate position with the \Ds.}

Whoever it is will be forced to lead a \S and eliminate your guess for the \SQ or else give you a ruff-sluff, allowing you to ruff in dummy and discard a \S loser from your hand.

When the bidding gets high in a hurry you sometimes have to guess what you can make. South plays 4\S. West leads the \HK.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

And it looks like you are too high. Assuming the trumps split 2-1, you still have one \H loser, two \D losers and one \C loser.

You win the \HA and play a \S to your \SK. East discards a \D! 

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

From bad to worse. Now you must add a \S loser to the four you already had. Are you finished?

No, never give up. West has a bunch of \Hs and 3 \Ss, so he cannot have many \Ds and \Cs. If you can eliminate those and then throw him in it should work to your advantage.

Play your \SA, the \DA and the \C A K. West follows to everything.

Now, West is still on lead, and he has nothing in his hand but good \Hs. So he leads one of them, and you DO NOT RUFF. Instead you discard a \C from dummy and a \D from your own hand. West has now taken his side's third trick. He plays another good \H, and you ruff in dummy and discard the last \D loser from your hand. You can now cross-ruff for the rest of the tricks.

Play one round of trumps with the \HA. You can't play any more because you will need an entry to dummy for the elimination.

Lead a \H to dummy's \HQ. West shows out. Play dummy's last \S. East is now void, so if he ruffs you over-ruff. Otherwise you ruff with a small trump.

Now throw West in (you hope!) with the \CT.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:S8,N:HQ,N:C8,S:H5,S:H2,S:CT]

Fortunately West has to take the \CT. Since he has nothing left but \Cs and \Ds he must lead one or the other. A \D lead will give you a trick with your \DK and a \C lead will allow you to ruff in dummy (East still has a \C) and discard a \D from your hand.

The contract is in danger if East holds the \CA because you would have three \C losers to go with the \D already lost. One really good possibility is that East now has the lone \DA and you can set up dummy's \DK with a ruff.

It would be great if you could ruff dummy's last \D, then get back to dummy with a trump so you could lead a \C from dummy and finesse. But check your trumps. If you do that you will have no more trumps in your hand and West won't be endplayed because you have no ruff-sluff. The only thing you can do is to go ahead and play \Cs now, finessing into West and HOPING he has no more \Ds!

But if it had turned out that West DID have another \D, and led it, all would not be lost. You would ruff in your hand, play a trump to dummy, then take a second \C finesse. If it turned out the \CK and \CQ were in different hands you would make the slam.}

If it is West who won the \DK you are home free. His \H play will give you two \H tricks.

If it is East who won the \DK you still have a chance. He will lead a \H and you will finesse the \HQ.
