With 23 points you naturally open 2\C. Partner responds 2\D. What do you bid next? [BID 2NT]

[show NS]



You have 23 points and no 5-card suit. Since your hand is balanced you bid 2NT. Partner raises to 3NT and you pass.}

With only 2 points you make a Negative 2\D response to partner's 2\C opener. He now bids 2NT. What is your bid? [BID pass]

[show NS]



This isn't as clear-cut a decision as you might think at first. Partner is showing 22-24 points, and even though you only have 2 points it is possible that the partnership total could be 26. The thing that should convince you to pass is that a 24-2 point split doesn't play nearly as well as say a 13-13 split would. Lack of transportation would likely kill any chance of 3NT (or 4\S). So you pass.}

With only 4 points you make a Negative 2\D response to partner's 2\C opener. He now bids 2NT. What is your bid? [BID 3NT]

[show NS]



True, 4 points isn't much. But added to partner's 22-24 it becomes enough for a game. Your problem isn't whether to bid to the game or not, (you definitely will), but whether you should use Stayman to find out if there is a 4-4 \S fit. You decide not to do this because your 4-3-3-3 distribution removes the possibility of you getting any ruffs. So you bid 3NT.}

You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then click on BID above. [BID 2\C]



You only have 20 points, but you have 9 playing tricks. You have two choices, open 4\H or open 2\C. Usually 4\H would show a slightly weaker hand than this, so you bid 2\C. Partner responds 2\D. What do you bid next? [BID 2\H]



Of course you bid your 8-card suit. But no jumping, just bid 2\H. Partner now says 2NT. What do you bid next? [BID 4\H]

[show NS]



Partner has between 3 and 7 points. Somewhere in those points might be the one trick you need, but you don't have any scientific way of finding out. So just bid 4\H and hope.(There it is, the \CT.)}

With 7 points you must bid a Negative 2\D. Partner now bids 2\H. What is your bid? [BID 3\D]

[show NS]



For someone who made an initial Negative response you have quite a good hand. You can't support partner's \Hs (yet) but you consider jumping to 3NT. All in all it is better to just describe your hand with a 3\D bid, then wait and see what partner says. You don't have to wait long since he bids 3NT which you pass.}

[show NS]



You have 22 points and 5-card Major suit. Your rebid is therefore 2\S. Partner raises to 4\S. His jump to game shows a weaker hand than a 3\S bid would so you pass.}

You have 6 points and bid a Negative 2\D. Partner now bids 2NT. What is your bid? [BID 3\C]



Partner has a balanced 22-24 points. With your 6 you want to be in game, but which game; 3NT, 4\H or 4\S? You can't answer that question unless you know if partner has a 4-card Major suit. So you bid 3\C, which is Stayman in this case. Partner replies 3\H. What do you say? [BID 4\H]

[show NS]



Knowing of the 4-4 fit you bid 4\H. By the way: Partner knew your 3\C bid was not the Second Negative because you don't use Second Negative following a 2NT rebid, you just pass.}

You bid your 5-card \H suit. Partner says 2NT. What do you bid now? [BID 3NT]

[show NS]



Partner's 2NT shows scattered values and fewer than 3 \Hs. He has 3 or more points or he would have bid the Double Negative. So you say 3NT.}

[show NS]



Hmmm, 22-24 balanced, plus 11 balanced equals 33-35 balanced. It makes you think a jump to 6NT would work out great. Just do it.}

With just 1 Jack you bid a Negative 2\D. Partner now bids 2\S. What is your bid? [BID 3\C]



Partner's bid of a suit is absolutely forcing, no matter how you feel about it. But now is the time you tell him you have fewer than 3 points by using the Second Negative. You bid 3\C. Partner now says 3\H. What do you say? [BID 3\S]

[show NS]



No, you still may not pass. First, because partner's bid of a new suit is forcing. Second, because even if you were not forced you prefer his first suit. So you bid 3\S and he passes.}

You now inform partner of your disaster hand by using the Second Negative. Since his suit is \Cs the Second Negative is 3\D. Partner now says 3NT. What do you say? [BID pass]

You definitely pass. Good thing he has 9 cold tricks in his hand!}

Partner has 8+ points and a good 5-card \H suit. Your hand has revalued to 25 points. You are forced to game but you don't want to bid it yet since you have slam in mind. So you temporize by showing your \H support. Partner bids 4\H. What do say? [BID 4NT]



You bid 4NT, asking for Aces. Partner replies 5\D. What now? [BID 6\H]

You now say 6\H and lay down a great dummy.}

Hmmm, 22-24 points added to your 16 comes to 38-40 points. Looking apologetically at your poor opponents you bid 7NT.}

Partner is not introducing a new suit here, you have already agreed on \Hs. He is making a control-showing bid of the \CA. He expects you to do the same if you can. Since you can show your Ace very conveniently below game level you bid 4\D. That was what he was hoping for, he bids 6\H.}

[show NS]



Obviously you could bid 7\S. But in fact you can count that there will be thirteen top tricks without a ruff; 5 \Ss, 2 \Hs, 3 \Ds and 3 \Cs. So you might as well bid 7NT.(By the way, the people who bid 7\S got the opening \C lead ruffed!)}
