You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then click on BID. [BID 1NT]

Do not be tempted to say 2\D, even with such good 3-card help. To support partner's minor suit opening you should have at least 4 cards in the suit. Remember he may have opened a 3-card suit.

Instead you bid 1NT showing a balanced 6-10 point hand with no 4-card Major suit. Partner passes.

South plays 1NT. West leads the \S4. East wins the \SA, then plays the \S9. West takes his \SK and leads another \S, East discarding a \H.

To make a PLAN for a Notrump contract you should count your winners.

Winners: \S 1 : \H 1 : \D 2 : \C 3 : Total = 7

For this deal you see that you already have all the winners you need to make the contract. So you just want to be sure you don't do something stupid that would jeopardize those winners.

You win the \SQ, then lead to the \CA, \CK, \CQ. Everybody follows suit to these three tricks. Next you take the \HA. Then you play a small \D to your \DK, then play your \DA. You have now won your required 7 tricks, but you have a bonus. Since all the \Cs except the \C8 have been played your \C8 is now high and you make an overtrick.

But even with this type of hand you should make sure you take them in the right order. Here, if you had played the \DA and \DK BEFORE you played the \C A K Q you would have had no entry back to the fourth \C in your hand. In this case it was only an overtrick, in other deals it could make the difference between making and going down.}

A jump to 2NT would be descriptive, but your first goal is to seek a Major suit fit. When you have two 4-card Majors you should respond "up-the-line" so you bid 1\H. Partner says 2\H. What do you bid now? [BID 4\H]

Partner would not support your \H suit without 4 cards so you have an 8-card Major fit. There is no point in bidding \Ss.

Partner has at least 13 points and you have 13 so you bid the game.

To make a PLAN for a suit contract you should count your losers.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 1 : \D 0 : \C 3 : Total = 4

There is nothing you can do about losing the Ace of trumps. The three \C losers would only happen if West has the \CA and East wins a trick early, (say with the \HA), and leads a \C through your \CK.

You can take care of this possibility by discarding a \C from dummy BEFORE you play trumps. So win the \DK, and play \SA, \SK, \SQ, discarding dummy's \C3 on the last one. Then pull trumps. You will end up losing two \Cs and the \HA.

Click NEXT to see the Deal that could have set you. [NEXT]

East would win his \HA and would switch to a black suit to lead up to dummy's weakness. In this case he would surely lead the \CQ, and you would lose three \C tricks and be down before you started.

It's nice to have a hand where the Winner count is 9. And guess what? West probably has the \SK, so you can finesse on the first trick for an overtrick.

HOLD IT! JUST STEP AWAY FROM THE QUEEN OF SPADES AND NOBODY WILL GET HURT.

What if you tried the finesse and East had the \SK? And what if he then switched to the \HQ? And what if your opponents then took the next 6 \H tricks? 

I think you get the idea. Win the \SA immediately and then take your other 8 tricks.

Winners: \S 0 : \H 1 : \D 1 : \C 4 : Total = 6

A hold-up won't help unless East had a doubleton \H, giving West a 7-card suit. So you win your \HA. The \S suit is solid after the \SA is played, but before you could enjoy those 3 tricks the defenders would have really enjoyed a bunch of \Hs.

Your only hope is to win 8 more tricks before you lose the lead. That means the \D finesse had better work. At trick 2 you lead your \DQ, playing low from dummy if West doesn't cover. Repeat the finesse as necessary. When West has the \DK you will make your contract, and when East has the \DK you will go down. That's a 50% chance, just like most finesses. But remember, if you had tried to establish the \S suit instead of taking the finesse your chance of making 3NT would be 0%.

With 16 points as Responder you are not quite strong enough for a jump-shift to 2 \D. That requires at least 17 points.

Winners: \S 1 : \H 2 : \D 5 : \C 0 : Total = 8

Let's say you hold up on the first \S, hoping they switch suits. HA! They aren't about to switch suits and they drive out your \SA at trick 2. That actually clears the situation up and makes this plan pretty simple to make.

You have taken 1 \S, and you will surely make 5 \Ds. Despite the solidity of those \Cs you dare not try to win a \C trick, because the defenders will pounce on that first \C and then win a bunch of \S tricks. 

So that makes it clear that you need 3 \H tricks, and there's only one way to get them. After taking your five \D tricks, play a \H to the \HK, then a \H back, finessing the \HJ. Half of the time you will make this contract, the other half of the time they will bury you with \Ss.

With no more outside losers your task is very very simple:DO NOT LOSE A TRUMP TRICK.

There is no problem if trumps split 2-2 or 3-1, so you can put your mind to 4-0 splits only. If West holds \H J 8 6 3 then it won't matter whether your first trump play is \HA or \HK, you will still be able to finesse the \HJ. But if East holds \H J 8 6 3 it is vital that you first play either the \HK or \HQ. If you start with the \HA you will have lost your finesse position. The general rule is to first play a high trump from the hand that has two. That preserves a finesse through either defender's \H J x x x.

Next visualize the situation if your first play was the \HK. West would show out and you would play the \HQ, then a small \H finessing your \HT.

Losers: \S 0? : \H 3 : \D 0 : \C 0 : Total = 3?

This Deal is VERY similar to Deal 9 in that you are only worried about a 4-0 trump split. The reason that it shows up right here is to point out the difference between J 8 6 3 and J T 6 3.

If East holds \S J T 6 3 then there is nothing you can do about it - you will go down. If you lead a \S from dummy he will "split his honors" by playing the \ST. This will force your \SA and he can just sit back and wait for his \SJ to make a trick.

But if it is West with \S J T 6 3 you can keep him from winning a \S trick, IF YOUR FIRST \S PLAY IS THE \SA. East shows out and you play a small \S toward dummy's \S K Q 9. If West plays low you insert the \S9, if he plays one of his honors you win it, then return to your hand and finesse him out of the other honor.

Aces and Spaces is the description you often hear about this hand. But the REAL description is 16 points, balanced. So you open 1NT. Partner replies 2NT. What do you bid now? [BID 3NT]

Partner is INVITING you to bid 3NT. If you have 17 points you should bid 3NT. If you have 15 points you should pass.

With 16 points you must make a judgement. This one is actually easy, despite the negative sound of "Aces and Spaces". In strength terms Aces are undervalued. Instead of being worth 4 points they are actually worth about 4.3 points. So you really do have a 17 point hand, and you bid 3NT.

Winners: \S 2 : \H 1 : \D 2 : \C 3 : Total = 8

Thanks to the opening lead you get an extra \D winner. Well, since the finesse would have worked it really isn't extra, it's just nice to know about it early. You need to find one more winner and the \C suit beckons. A 3-3 split would be very nice, but a 4-2 is more likely. Even with a 4-2 split you can still make your fifth \C good - but you must be careful with entries.

Since you have no immediate problem in any suit you can afford to give up the lead. So you play the \C2 from your hand and the \C3 from dummy. In other words, you duck a \C. Somebody will win this trick cheaply and no doubt play another \D. You don't mind at all - you win the \DQ, the \S A K, the \HA and dummy's \C A K Q 4, all of which are good.

If you played a high \C first you would never have an entry back to dummy. You would have been forced to try to get there with the \HJ but as you can see, that wouldn't work.

If you had just played the \Cs from the top you would have made an overtrick when they split 3-3, but gone down when they split 4-2. Making an overtrick about 40% of the time is a high price to pay for going down the other 60%.}

This is awkward. With 8 points you must respond, but you cannot bid a new suit at the 2-level without 11 or more. Although you are far from balanced you must say 1NT.

Losers: \S ? : \H 0 : \D 1 : \C 0 : Total = ?

That 1 \D loser is definite. So instead of guessing how many \S losers you have, just approach it from the viewpoint that you can afford 2 but not 3.

If the missing \Ss split 3-3 then your life is easy. You play \SA, then any \S. Win their return and play any \S. The defense can win two \Ss but no more.

It's when the \Ss are splitting 4-2 that you must be careful. If somebody has \S K Q 9 3 for example you will go down. The one important distribution to guard against is a doubleton honor in one hand. In this case your second \S play must be a LOW \S. When this drives out one honor your \S J T can insure that only one more trick is lost.

With 11 points you know you want to reach game since partner has at least 15. However, you aren't sure at this point just which game to reach. If you knew partner held 3\Hs you'd choose 4\H since you would have an 8-card Major fit. On the other hand, if you knew partner had only a doubleton \H you would choose 3NT, which would probably be better. So you jump to 3\H. This bid tells partner to "Pick a Game".

Winner count: \S 2 : \H 0 : \D 2 : \C 1 : Total = 5

Although the \D and \C suits offer the possibility for creating a winner it is evident that you really need to bring in the \Hs. By driving out the \HA you will establish the 4 winners that you need. The problem is that when you play \HQ then \HJ a good defender will hold up his \HA. You could get to dummy with the \SA and continue \Hs, but you would no longer have a sure entry to get back to those winners.

There is an almost foolproof plan. Win the first trick with your \SK (saving dummy's \SA). Lead \HQ, then \HJ, OVERTAKING WITH DUMMY'S \HK. Now continue the \HT driving out the \HA. You will be able to reach the \H tricks with the \SA.

You may not have had a problem with this opening bid, but be assured that many would. The hand meets all the requirements for an opening 1NT bid, balanced distribution and 16 points. So lots of good players would open 1NT. However, there is the question of the 5-card Major. Another group of good players don't open 1NT when their hand contains a 5-card Major.

So let us agree that either could be right and say that you chose 1\H. West overcalls 1\S, partner says 2\H and you pass.

Losers: \S 2 : \H 2 : \D 0 : \C 2 : Total = 6

You might get lucky in the trump suit and only lose one trick, but you can't count on it. Dummy's \D suit has two extra winners, but there is the problem of transportation. By the time you get to enjoy those two winners you might have already lost six tricks.

One thing should be crystal clear. If you now lead a trump the defenders will win and cash 2 \Ss. You can avoid this by waiting on the trumps and playing \DK, then overtake the \DJ with dummy's \DQ. Then play \DA and discard a \S. Now from dummy you can lead a \H and perhaps play your \HK but even if it loses you will still make the contract.

Make sure you visualize how the play would have gone if you had played a trump to the second trick. When you see clearly the bad things that are likely to happen you will look harder for a remedy. When confronted with a hand such as this many beginning (or careless) players just automatically start trying to pull trumps. And many times they go down on hands that could have been made.}

Let's start over. Play \HK, then \HA. East shows out. If you play another \H West will pull all the trumps and they will start winning \D tricks. Lots of \D tricks.

So don't lead the third \H. Leave West with his two master trumps and start playing \C winners. West will eventually ruff in with one of his high trumps and perhaps take a \D trick.

Do not support partner's Major suit response with only 3 cards. It is good to raise partner's Major suit OPENING with 3 trumps because he guarantees a 5-card suit. As a RESPONSE he only promises a 4-card suit, so you should have 4 in the suit to give immediate support.

In fact you have a perfect bid. With a balanced hand and 18-19 points you open 1 of a suit, then jump in Notrump. Holding 18 points you bid 2NT and partner raises to 3NT.

You need 2 more winners and they will come from the \D suit once you have forced out the \DA. There is a problem though. When the opponents get the lead with the \DA they might cash 4 \H tricks. Of course if it is East who wins the \DA and if he doesn't have a \H to play then all will be well. So you don't take your \HA on the first trick, nor do you take it on the second trick. At trick 3 you have no choice so you win your \HA. 

Now you can take your 4 \C tricks if you like. Then lead a \D honor. If they don't take their \DA on this trick you play another \D honor. One of the defenders will win this trick. If it is East you will make your contract, if it is West you will go down.

The two \D losers are already lost, so you must eliminate a \C loser. If West has the \CK then a simple finesse will win the day. That would be a 50% chance, right? WRONG! That would be a 0% chance. You and partner hold 23 HCP. West has already produced 4 HCP with the \DA, and if he had 3 more that would mean East opened with only 10 points. Very doubtful.

So face it, East has the \CK.

However, dummy has some nice \S cards. So you pull the last trump, play your \S3 to dummy's \SA, then lead the \SQ. If East puts on his \SK (which you know he must have) you ruff it. Then enter dummy with a \D ruff and discard the small \C on the good \SJ. If East doesn't play his \SK you discard your  \C loser immediately.

You need two more winners and you can almost surely get them in \Ds. In fact, if the suit splits 2-2 you could actually get three more winners. But the danger here is that if they DON'T split 2-2 and if East happens to win the third \D he might lead a \S. And that might lead to disaster!

Instead, you allow for the possibility that \Ds may not split evenly and you make sure East (the Danger hand) doesn't get the lead. Win the \HK in dummy. Play the \DA, (which happens to draw the \DJ from West), then play a small \D and finesse with the \D9. If West can win the trick then the \Ds have split 2-2 and your other 3 \Ds are good.

That question mark means that if \Ss don't split 3-2 you will have 2 losers in which case the \D finesse will just have to work. However, the 3-2 split will probably occur, so you make your PLAN based on that.

Unless West is a complete moron dummy's \HK is a goner no matter what you do. So you duck, then ruff the \HJ continuation. Next you play \SA, \SK, both defenders following. At this point one defender still holds the master \SQ and you must decide whether to leave it outstanding or force them to play it. 

When dummy has a side suit you want to run but no outside entries it usually pays to drive out the master trump. So you play another \S and East wins the \SQ.

You expect trumps to split 3-2 so you would lose 2 trumps. You have no other losers so you decide to pull trumps. You win the \HA and play the \SA. East plays the \SK!

Do you change your Plan? Click? [NEXT]

Well, East may be false-carding. He may also have the \SQ for example. But if you decide to play another trump and it turns out he was NOT false-carding you will be dead in the water. West will take his three trump tricks and some \Hs. Many \Hs.

So don't take the chance. Abandon trumps and start playing \C winners. Let West take the three trumps whenever he wants to. You will not lose control of the hand and will make your T tricks.

As you see, West would have pulled your and dummy's trumps and then won 3 \H tricks.

A slightly different Plan would also have worked. At trick two you could have played a low trump from both hands. East would win the \SK, then probably play another \H. You ruff, play a \S to the \SA and discover the split. From there the Plan is the same, play your \Cs and let West ruff when he wants. }

You only need one more winner and there are possibilities in \Ss, \Hs and \Ds. But you need to be very careful. If you watched those \C spots you will realize that West started with 5 \Cs (he led the \C4, later played the \C3). So the defenders will win 2 more \C tricks to go with the 2 they already have. And they can also take the \HA and \HK whenever they want. In other words, they also have 6 winners. So the battle is for the 7th trick for either side. If you do anything that gives them a trick they will win.

So you don't try for a trick in \Ss or \Ds. Instead you play on \Hs, the suit where they have the 2 sure winners anyway. They will win one of their high honors, take their 2 \Cs, then play either \Ss or \Ds. You win and drive out the other \H honor.

You have one loser too many. It doesn't seem you can do anything about the 3 \Ds but you might be able to avoid one of the \Cs if you are lucky. However, you can probably get rid of the \H loser by ruffing it in dummy. 

One small worry - East's play of the \H9 might be the start of a doubleton signal. If so, he may be able to over-ruff dummy. You should have played the \HA on the first trick. Next you pull two rounds of trumps with \SA, \SK. Only then do you play \HK and \H8 ruffing with dummy's last trump. Fortunately East only had two trumps and cannot over-ruff, even though he is out of \Hs.

When you get back in you will pull trumps and lead toward dummy's \C K J, hoping to make a good guess.

There is an excellent bidding guideline which tells you how to respond with two 4-card Majors. You bid them "up-the-line". That means you bid 1\H.

Partner's rebid is 1\S. What do you bid? [BID 3\S]

This hand shows why responder should bid "up-the-line". Partner can now show a 4-card \S suit at the 1-level. Imagine the suits reversed - you first respond with 1\S. If partner wanted to show a \H suit he would have to go to the 2-level, and he might not have the strength to do so.

Back to the actual situation. Over partner's 1\S bid you jump to 3\S. This jump shows about 11-12 points and good \S support (4 cards). In case you thought this showed 13 or more points that wouldn't be logical. If you had 13 points and 4 \Ss you would jump all the way to game. So 3\S is invitational. Partner accepts the invitation.

The two black Aces aren't going away so if you are to make this contract you must do something about your \D loser. And the only likely place to put it is on dummy's \SK. If West has the \SA, you can lead up to the \SK and make a winner out of it.

Suppose you win the \DQ in dummy and play a \C. Somebody will win the \CA and play another \D. You win this and lead toward the \SK. No good. West jumps up with his \SA and sets you with a \D winner.

The problem was that when you played a trump you let the timing go to the defense. They could knock out your last \D stopper while they still had the \SA. Try it this way.

Win the \D in your hand and immediately play the \S9. If West doesn't take his \SA he'll never get it, so assume he goes up. Now he leads \DJ but you win, get to dummy with the \HK and play the \SK, discarding the \D loser.

You can create one winner in \Ds if they split 3-2, but too late, the defense would have set up their \Hs. So you must get 2 more \S tricks.

This is one of the most misplayed positions in bridge. The usual approach is to lead the \SQ, hoping that West holds the \SK. But this can't succeed. If West does hold the \SK he will cover, either this trick or the \SJ, and someone's \ST will become a winner. Of course if East has the \SK then the finesse will fail, along with your chance of 2 more winners.

The correct way to play for 2 more tricks is to hope EAST has the \SK and lead twice toward your \S Q J. So win the first trick, play \S4 to dummy's \SA. Lead the \S3 toward your hand, playing the \SJ if East plays low. (Of course if East ever plays the \SK he gives you two winners immediately.) When the \SJ wins, return to dummy with the \DA and lead the \S6 toward your \SQ.

You might think that West is just as likely to have held an original doubleton \S A K as doubleton \S A T, and that playing the \S9 would be as good a play as \SQ.

This is untrue for a very classy-named reason - The Principle of Restricted Choice. You may not even believe it when you read it, but it's mathematically sound. If West were dealt an original \S A K, he would have been just as likely to win with the \SK as with the \SA. The fact that he actually won the \SA makes it less likely that he also holds the \SK.}

A jump to 2NT would not be a terrible bid. But it is more important to show your 4-card Major.

So you bid 1\S instead. Partner raises to 2\S.

What do you bid next? [BID 4\S]

It's another case of HE WHO KNOWS, GOES. You know you have at least 26 points and 8 \Ss. Of course you trust that partner would not raise a suit you bid as responder with only 3 trumps. So you bid 4\S.

South plays 4\S. West leads the \HK. The defense takes the first three \H tricks, then switch to a \C.

It kinda makes you wish you'd bid 2NT after all doesn't it?

At least the picture is clear. Very clear. You have no wiggle room left so you must bring in the \Ss without losing a trick. So West MUST have the \SK. Therefore you assume West does hold the \SK. 

Suppose you lead the \SQ. West will play his \SK and force you to play dummy's \SA. Then one of the defenders will win the third \S with the \ST or \S9.

No, you only have one chance to make this contract - West must hold a doubleton \S K x. So you lead a SMALL \S from your hand and finesse dummy's \SJ. Then play the \SA, dropping West's \SK, then pull the last trump with the \SQ.

This looks scary. Needing 5 more tricks means you are going to have to establish BOTH red suits. And with only two \S stoppers you have to hope West doesn't have both red Aces. If he does, you're down, so just assume that he only has one of them. Now if you can just figure out which Ace West has you can establish that suit first.

But you don't have to guess, there is a better way. West overcalled at the 2-level with a Queen-high suit and one outside Ace. THAT is bold. Surely he has at least a 6-card suit to justify that overcall. If so, then a simple hold-up will be worthwhile. So you let West hold the first trick, and when he leads another \S you win the \SK in your hand. If West has a 6-card suit East is now void of \Ss.

Play \Ds to drive out the \DA. If East has it he will not have another \S to force you with. If West has it he can force out your last \S, but then won't have the \HA for an entry. However the Aces are split - as long as West doesn't have both - you will establish 9 tricks.

If West has both \CA and \CK you could save yourself 1 \C loser, but the odds are about 3 to 1 against that. Your best chance of making this contract is just to hold your \S losers to 1. With an expected 3-2 split there will not be a problem, but you might as well take extra pains if you can do so without risk.

So after you ruff the \HK you do NOT play the \SK. Instead you play a \D to dummy and lead a \S toward your honors. Your extra pains pay off when East plays the \SA, which was a singleton.

It turns out there was a fourth reason not to bid 3\S - the opponents might lead the suit.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 1/2 : \D 1 : \C 4 : Total = 6/7

The \S lead is about the best thing that could have happened to you. You win with dummy's \SA and play \SK, discarding your \D. You then lead a small \C, covering anything East plays. You'd like to ruff a \C if you can, but if they play trumps to stop you then you'd like the trump play to come from West. West leads the \H3, East plays the \HK, and you win with the \HA. You play a small \C. If the defender who wins the \C doesn't play another trump then you can ruff your third \C in dummy. If the defender DOES play a trump, then you lose only one trump trick. You end up going down 1, which is pretty good.

If West has the \SK then a finesse will gain you the two winners you need. However, if East has the \SK then the finesse will gain you just one winner and you will be hoping for a  3-3 \C split for the other. While this is a possible Plan, there is a far better one.

Rather than chance the \S finesse, you should immediately start establishing your \Ds. This has the advantage of not giving the defense any NEW winners - they were always going to get their two high \Ds. So win the \HA and play the \DT. Somebody will take this and probably continue with a \H. Take the \HQ and play the \DQ. Somebody will take this and probably continue with a \H. Take the \HK and then the rest of your winners.

Because you have an invitational hand with a 4-card Major (\Ss) you use Stayman.

After your 2\C bid partner says 2\D.

What do you bid next? [BID 2\H]

Partner does not have 4 (\Ss) so you have no 8-card fit there. However, he might have 3 \Hs, so you now bid 2\H. Partner will understand you are showing a 5-card suit.

Partner bids 3\H. What do you say? [BID pass]

This could go either way. You started out with 9 points, but perhaps you could revalue your hand upward after you find the fit. The problem with that is those two doubletons are in the long-trump hand, and taking ruffs in the long-trump hand doesn't usually add tricks. You take the conservative route and pass.

You may be able to ruff 1 \S in dummy, and discard another on a long \D. And you hope to keep your trump losers to 1.

Start by covering the \CJ to set up a sure \C trick. East wins the \CA and returns a \C, won by dummy's \CK. It looks better to start the trumps from your side, so play a \D toward your \DK. West wins and plays a \C, which you ruff. Now lead a \H, playing the \HK if West plays low. Assume this wins the trick. Lead a \H back, finessing the \H9 since you think West must hold the \HA. He does hold it, and takes it right now. West leads a \S. You win the \SA in dummy, play the \S7 to your \SK, and ruff a \S with dummy's last trump. Now lead dummy's \D Q J, discarding a \S on the last one. You have only good trumps left.

For partner to take you out of Notrump he must have a distributional hand, probably with a singleton or void in one of the black suits. You have to make the choice between passing, bidding 4\D or 5\D, or bidding 3NT.

You are now at the crossroads. For your ninth trick should you try the \D finesse or should you establish a \H. It's a no-brainer. If you finesse a \D and it loses to East's \DQ a \S will come back, knocking out your last stopper.

You are glad the defense started with \Hs, that was a suit you would have had to play yourself. You need one more winner and your first thought may be that the \Ss are going to have to split 3-3. However, that happens only about 40% of the time so you keep looking. There is one more card that might be valuable, the \CJ. If East holds the \CQ then you can make a trick out of the \CJ.

You are already in dummy with the \HJ so you lead a small \C. If East plays low you will play the \CJ which will hold the trick and become your 9th winner. If East plays his \CQ you will have the \CJ for your 9th winner later.

You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then click on BID. [BID 1\H]

Your first bid is easy, you say 1\H. But what do you say after partner's 2\H response? [BID 3\C]

You have 18 points and partner has 6-T. Doing the math, you total 24-28.

You want to make a bid that will tell partner to bid game if he has 9-T, but will stop at 3\H if he only has 6-7. Lots of players will bid 3\H with this hand to make just that invitation. There's nothing wrong with that bid.

But there is an improvement. Bid 3\C instead. Partner knows you aren't showing him a \C suit, why would you do that after agreeing on \Hs? What it means is "Partner I'm inviting you to bid the game if you have maximum, but if your decision is close decide based on \Cs, the suit I could use help in." It is called a HELP SUIT GAME TRY. Partner has 8 points and the \CA and decides that is enough to bid game.

South plays 4\H. West leads the \SK.

You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then click on BID. [BID 1\S]

You don't quite have the strength for a jump-shift, and in any case sometimes it is better to proceed slowly. So you respond 1\S, knowing partner must bid again. 

He does bid again, surprising you when he says 2\S. What do you bid? [BID 3\C]

All of a sudden your hand has become gigantic. Never mind points, you have only 5 possible losers in your hand and partner has opened the bidding. Surely he can take care of a few of them.

You want to try for slam. DO NOT BID BLACKWOOD! With two quick losers in \Ds you would not know what to do if Partner showed only one Ace. You wouldn't know whether the defense could take the first two \D tricks or not. A better approach is to use a control bid. 

So you bid 3\C. Partner will absolutely know that you aren't bidding a \C suit, he knows you have already agreed on \Ss. He will take you to be showing first round control in \Cs, probably the \CA.

Partner bids 3\D. What do you bid next? [BID 4NT]

Partner's 3\D is a control bid showing the \DA. Do not even consider that he is trying to get back to \Ds, you both know that your suit is \Ss. 

NOW you use Blackwood, knowing you are not in danger of losing two quick \Ds.

Partner replies 5\H, showing two Aces. What do you bid? [BID 6\S]

Your side has all the Aces but don't get greedy. Remember that partner made a minimum bid at his second turn. He couldn't have two Aces and three Kings. 

So you bid the small slam.

South plays 6\S. West leads the \HQ.

You pull trumps in one round with your \SK. Play \D A K, then ruff a \D. if both defenders follow then both dummy's \Ds are good and you will make 7. However, it is more likely that \Ds will split 4-2, in which case you return to dummy with the \SJ and ruff the fourth \D.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 0 : \D 1 : \C 3 : Total = 4

There are two ways to get rid of one of those \C losers. You can lead up to the \CK, hoping that West holds \CA, or you can ruff it in dummy.

Suppose you try to combine both chances. Win the \SK, then play a small \H to your hand. Lead a \C and play dummy's \CK. East takes the \CA and plays another trump which you win in your hand. You play another \C but East wins this one also and leads another trump, removing dummy's last hope of ruffing a \C. Down 1.

Instead you could give up on the idea of leading toward the \CK and just lead a \C from dummy at trick 2. The defenders can win and lead a trump, but you play a second \C. They win this also but even if they lead a trump you can still ruff your third \C in dummy and make the game.

You can also see that leading a \H back to your hand at trick 2 is a bad idea.

Win the \DA and play \HA, \HK, \H2. The defenders will win this. If your \H3 happened to set up then you won't have to ruff it, but more than likely the \Hs split 4-2.

You need 3 more winners and clearly they must come from the \D suit. If West happens to hold the \DK all will be well, but what about the times when East holds it?

The immediate, burning question is whether to win the first trick or not. By winning you will create a second \S stopper - as long as East never gets into the lead. But the problem is that your main finesse is going into East. So you hold up on the first trick, sacrificing the chance of a second stopper. When East returns a \S you hold up again, playing the \SJ which West wins with the \SQ. Your \SA is finally driven out on the third trick.

Now you take the \D finesse, losing to East's \DK (as expected). But it doesn't matter because East has no more \Ss. Whatever he plays you win and take all your winners, which happen to add up to 9.

Losers: \S 2 : \H 1 : \D 1 : \C 1 : Total = 5

One of the \S losers will be ruffed in dummy so you really just have to eliminate one loser.

It is very tempting to win the first trick in dummy and immediately finesse East for the \HK. If the finesse works then all will be well, but if it fails another \D will knock out your \DA. Then, when the defense gets into the lead with a \S or \C they will cash their \D winner.

Here is a better idea. Win the first trick in your hand with the \DA, and immediately lead a low \S toward the \SQ. If West holds the \SK he is caught in the middle. If he ducks you play the \SQ and don't lose any \Ss. If he goes up you can win a later trick with the \SQ and dump dummy's \D loser on your \SA.

But there are many situations when that is NOT the best plan. Perhaps because you need to ruff something in dummy, or perhaps (like this hand) because playing trumps would give the timing to the defense.

The \C losers are shown as 1 since you will always be able to ruff a \C in dummy.

North's precipitous leap to 4\H was made partly in hopes of making the contract, and partly as a preemptive bid to shut the opponents up. So it wouldn't be a surprise to land in an unmakeable contract. However, this one has a slim chance. The only suit you might make something of is \Ss. If West holds the \SA then leading up to the \SK would eliminate one of the \S losers - that would at least get you to down only 1. 

Or, if West holds the \SQ and East the \SA then leading up to the \SJ would also eliminate one \S loser. But this play has another advantage - if West should happen to hold BOTH the \SA and \SQ then leading up to the \SJ will actually let you make the contract. So you win the \CA, pull two trumps, then play a \S to the \SJ. If that wins, back to your hand with a trump and play your other \S to the \SK.

West probably has a 7-card suit to overcall at the 3-level, so if you play the \SA East will ruff and one of your winners will disappear. So don't play the \SA.

It's nice to make Plans for slams because there are so few losers to worry about.

This one is definitely straightforward. You need to get one more winner. You can hope for a 3-3 \H split which would mean your fourth \H would become a winner, or you can hope that West has the \DQ in which case a simple finesse will give you the winner. But instead of making it an either/or situation you can combine your chances.

Win the first trick in either hand and duck a \H. Win the return and play your 4 \C winners (discarding a \D from your hand) followed by your other 2 \S winners. Then play \DA, \HK and \HA.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 2 : \D 2 : \C 0 : Total = 4

The two fast losers in \Hs can't be helped, but maybe you can get rid of one of the \D losers.

Win the \DA and play the \C6 to your \CA. Play \SA, then a small \S to dummy's \SJ. Lead the \CQ. If East covers, ruff and re-enter dummy with a trump so you can discard a \D loser on the \CJ. If East doesn't cover the \CQ when you lead it, discard a \D immediately. As long as East holds the \CK you can make the contract. This is called a Ruffing Finesse.

You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then click on BID. [BID 2\C]

You certainly have a Notrump type hand, but you are too strong to open 2NT.

With 23 points you open 2\C. Partner says 2\D.

What is your next bid? [BID 2NT]

Now you show your 23 point, balanced hand by bidding 2NT. This is not forcing on partner, he might pass.

However, he doesn't pass, he says 3\C.

What is your next bid? [BID 3\H]

This is no different than a 3\C bid after an opening 2NT. It is Stayman.

So you bid your 4-card \H suit and partner bids the game.

South plays 4\H. West leads the \C2. The defense takes three \C tricks, then plays a small \D.

The defense takes three \C tricks, then plays a small \D.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 1 : \D 0 : \C 3 : Total = 4

Since you've already lost the 3 \C tricks the Goal of your Plan is simple - Don't Lose the \H.

That makes the card assumptions simple also - East Must Have the \HK.

You only have one dummy entry so once you use it you must remain in dummy until you have finished finessing. If East has the \H K x you can't go wrong. If he has \H K x x you will have to play with care. And if he has \H K x x x you must play perfectly.

Enter dummy with the \SK. Lead the \H9 and let it ride. Assuming it wins, lead the \HJ and play your \HT under it. Now lead a small \H and finesse the \HQ. This way you get all four \H tricks. No other way will work.

Click NEXT to see why. [NEXT]

VISUALIZE:

(1) That your first play from dummy was  \HJ, and you played \H3 from your hand. The next \H would have to be taken in your hand and you no longer have a finesse.

(2) That your first play from dummy was the \HJ and you played \HT under it. To stay in dummy one more trick you would have to play the \H9 and put the \H3 under it. But when you play the \H9 East will cover with his \HK. You can win with the \HA but are left with \H Q 3 and the lead will be in your hand. You will lose a trick to East's \H 8 5.}

With 13 points and good 4-card support you are strong enough to jump to 3\C.

However an 11 trick minor game is not as attractive as a 9 trick Notrump game, so you should also consider a jump to 2NT.

Looking at all those Kings should sway you to 2NT. You prefer to be declarer on this hand so the opening lead comes up to one those Kings. Partner bids 3NT.

Winners: \S 2 : \H 1 : \D 2 : \C 2 : Total = 7

The opening lead gave you 1 \H trick. If \Cs split 2-2 you can make T tricks! But wait, you only need 9 tricks. What if you play 2 top \Cs and it turns out East has \C Q x x ? He could win the next \C and lead a \H through your \H K 9. That would not be good.

So East is the Danger hand and he must be kept out of the lead. At trick two cross to dummy with the \CA. Then play the \CJ, letting it ride if East doesn't cover. If West has the \CQ you will lose the trick but he cannot play \Hs without setting up your \HK. You will win 4 \C tricks and the game. If East actually does have the \CQ you will make an overtrick.

That old guideline says you should finesse for a missing Queen when you and partner have eight cards in the suit, but play for the drop when you have nine.

Losers: \S 1 : \H 1 : \D 0 : \C 1 : Total = 3

The \C lead was pleasant, it gave you a free finesse. But it didn't really give you a winner since you would have ended up taking the finesse yourself even without the lead. Still, it clears the position somewhat.

You can't get rid of the \S loser, nor can you get rid of the \H loser. By process of elimination then, you must get rid of the \C loser. You could ruff it in dummy, but the play to the first trick makes you a little worried about an over-ruff by East. You could ruff with the \DA, but then if someone started with \D J T 8 you'd lose a natural \D trick.

First test the \Ds by playing the \DK. West shows out and there goes your hope of ruffing the \C with the \DA. You have one more possibility to try. Play the \HA, then a small \H toward the \HQ. If West holds the \HK dummy's \HQ will be promoted to a winner that you can dump your \C loser on.

Between the \H loser and the \C loser which one can you eliminate? Easy question, fast losers like the \HA are tough to eliminate. Usually you work on those slow losers.

The logical way to remove that \C loser is to ruff it in dummy. But do it carefully. It would be silly to play \CA, \CK, \CQ and then try to ruff the \C4. That is just begging for an over-ruff. It would be better to just take two rounds of \Cs, then ruff the \C4. But even that isn't the best.

First take two rounds of trumps with the \SA and \SK. Then play two top \Cs. Only then do you ruff the \C4.

If the \C finesse works you have no \C loser, and as a bonus you will be able to discard one of your other losers. Even if the finesse fails you still have an extra winner for the discard.

Is there a danger here? Yes. Suppose you win the first trick, pull trumps, then finesse the \C. East might win and play a \S back to West's hand. And West might then lead a \D through dummy's \DK.

West is the Danger Hand. You want to keep him off the lead. His only possible entry is the \S suit, so all you have to do is hold up on the first trick. Win the second \S, pull trumps as before, and finesse the \C. East wins but cannot get to his partner's hand for the killing \D lead. You will discard one of your \D losers on dummy's fourth \C.

You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then click on BID. [BID 2NT]

You were probably stunned when you picked up this hand and even more stunned when partner bid.

Your biggest problem is that partner has opened with a weak bid and won't credit you with such a huge hand. So you must make sure you don't make a bid he might pass until you're ready.

For example, suppose you made a jump shift to 4\C. Would partner know what that meant? Do you know what it meant?

The best(?) bid at this point is probably 2NT. Everybody knows what that means. Partner is forced to reply, and will either rebid his suit with a minimum hand or show a "feature" if his hand is better than minimum.

Partner replies 3\D. What do you bid now? [BID 6NT]

Trust your partner. He has shown a better-than-minimum Weak-2 bid, probably 9-11 points, and a high card in \Ds, either the \DA or \DK.

With your hand you don't need anything else to make a slam. You have to decide between 6\H and 6NT. Based on your reluctance to have an opening \C lead go through your \C A Q you choose 6NT.

In fact, your only real problem is making sure you get all 6 \H winners. If the \Hs split 3-2 it's easy, but if they are 4-1 you cannot afford to overtake the \HJ at the second trick. Fortunately dummy has both the \DK and the \D9.

Win the \SA. Play \HA and \HJ. West shows out on the second one. Lead your \D2 to dummy's \D9. Either you are in dummy now to run the \Hs, or East wins the trick with the \DA. In this case you can win his return (don't finesse if he leads a \C), and get to dummy with the \DK to run the \Hs.

MAYBE East will have the \SA and the \HK. But maybe not. You do have an extra \D trick so you need to determine the best use you can make of that.

First pull trumps. It takes one round. Play your other \D winner and discard one of dummy's \Ss. This protects you from losing more than one \S. Enter dummy with a trump and lead the last \S. Assume East has the \SA. If he goes up with it you will be able to dump dummy's \H loser on your \SK. If he plays low you put on your \SK and you no longer have a \S loser.

If it turns out West has the \SA then your \S play didn't work. In that case you would enter dummy again and try the \H finesse. This plan is a winner if East holds EITHER the \HK or the \SA.

That was just what North needed. He only had 7 points but decided the \D help was worth an extra point or two.

South plays 4\H. West leads the \CA, \CK, \CQ.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 0 : \D 2 : \C 2 : Total = 4

You must eliminate one \D loser, that means ruffing it in dummy. You would like to pull trumps first but you cannot chance pulling two rounds because if they don't split 2-2 you would have to leave one out until after you had ruffed the \D. The problem would then be that the defender who took the \DA might lead the third trump, preventing your ruff.

So first you must drive out the \DA. After you ruff the \C you play a \D to dummy's \DK. East takes the \DA and leads a trump. You win in your hand, pull one more trump, then play \DQ, \D7, ruffing in dummy. Back to your hand with the \SA, pull the last trump and claim.

Losers: \S 1 : \H 3? : \D 0 : \C 1 : Total = 5?

The loser count is somewhat misleading because obviously you can ruff some \Hs in dummy.

Sometimes it is better to count winners, even though it is a suit contract. Winners: \S 2 : \H 1 : \D 2 : \C 2 : Total = 7

Thinking like this makes it clear that you must win 3 of your 4 small trumps. The best way to do this is to win the \HA and pull 2 rounds of trumps with \SA and \SK, spurning the finesse. Trumps split 3-2, so leave the master trump out and cash your other high card winners. Then start cross-ruffing, \Hs in dummy and \Ds in your hand. The defender with the master trump is welcome to ruff with it whenever he wants - it won't stop you from coming to T tricks.

Losers: \S 3 : \H 0 : \D 2 : \C 1 : Total = 6

There is no hope of extra winners except the \D suit. You are wide open in \Ss, so you have to hope that West holds the \DK. But that won't be enough by itself, in case he has \D K x x x you also have to have three entries to your hand. Two of them will be the \HA and \HQ and the third entry must be the \CA.

So you win the first trick with the \CA and immediately take your first \D finesse. It wins, so you return to your hand with a \H to the \HQ and take another \D finesse. Back to your hand with the \HA (pulling the last trumps) and take a third \D finesse. Finally on the \DA you can discard either your \C loser or a \S. You will have to give up three tricks at the end.

Losers: \S 1 : \H 1 : \D 1 : \C 1 : Total = 4

You know you can't get rid of the \D loser, and it's hard to imagine a way that would let you get rid of the \C loser. The \H loser depends on the finesse. So you should try to find somewhere to put the \S loser.

First you win the \SA. You know that you will eventually take the \H finesse, so should you take it now? Visualize the likely defense actions if you do. Say East wins the \HK. He will surely play another \S, knocking out dummy's \SK. Whenever you try to set up \Ds the defense will take their \S trick and you will eventually go down.

What happened is that you gave the defense a tempo and let them control the timing of the play. You should not have rushed into the \H finesse. Instead suppose that you win the first trick with dummy's \SK and immediately play the \DQ. The defense can take their \DA when they want to and push another \S, but now the timing is on your side. You can discard a \S from dummy on your good \D in time.

You hold up on this trick and East returns the \D3.

Winners: \S 1 : \H 4 : \D 1 : \C 0 : Total = 6

You need to get three more winners and you have two very clear possibilities.

If East holds the \SK you can finesse him out of it and win an additional 3 tricks in the suit. The problem with this approach is that half the time West will hold the \SK and you will go down.

Or you can drive out the \CA and definitely set up an additional 3 tricks in that suit. The problem with this approach is that if the defender's \Ds split 5-3 they will be able to win 4 \Ds and the \CA.

If you pay attention to the opening lead this becomes a simple decision. West led the \D2. Assuming that was fourth down then he must have led from a 4-card suit. So it looks like the \Ds must be splitting 4-4 and it is safe for you to establish \Cs. So you drive out the \CA. The defenders take their other 2 \Ds but you make the game losing only 3 \Ds and the \CA.

West's lead of the \D2 should have made you pretty sure that he had led from a 4-card suit. If the \D2 is fourth down, there cannot be a fifth down. Additionally, East's return of the \D3 confirmed that conclusion. If East had started with only 3 \Ds, (say \D Q 6 3) his correct return at trick 2 would have been his next highest, the \D6. With 4 cards in the suit his correct return is his original fourth down.}

You have a loser in each suit and must eliminate one of them. Since the defense can take their Aces whenever they want to you need to find a place to put your "slow" \H loser. There are two possibilites, but each must be tried immediately because once you lose the lead the defenders will set up their \H.

You could win the \H in your hand and lead toward the \CK. If West holds \CA you can establish the \CK for a \H discard.

You could win in dummy and set up a \D no matter which defender holds \DA. You could then discard a \H from dummy on your good \D. This is obviously the better choice since it works with any distribution.

With a balanced hand and 16 points you open 1NT. In the Bridge dictionary under "Opening 1NT Bid" they probably have a picture of this hand. Partner responds 2NT. What do you bid? [BID 3NT]

Partner's 2NT bid is invitational. Specifically it tells you to pass with 15 points or bid 3NT with 17 points. But it doesn't tell you what to do when you have 16 points. So you have to make a judgement about your hand. Is it closer to 15 or closer to 17? The answer is definitely "closer to 17". Aces are actually worth a little more than 4 points and you have three of them. Also, most of your spot cards are higher than average, with only one card below a 7. So you bid 3NT.

Winner count: \S 2 : \H 2 : \D 0 : \C 1 : Total = 5

You are bound to get 2 winners in \Ss. You need to create 4 winners and the \D suit offers the perfect opportunity. Drive out the \DA and the other four \Ds are winners. But there is a very critical problem. If the defenders hold up their \DA until the third round of the suit you may be locked out of dummy.

Suppose you win the first \S with your \S8. Then you start on \Ds and the defense wins the third one and leads a \H. You win the \H but your only hope of reaching dummy is with a \S. If you take your \SA, then lead a low one West will take his \SK and two more. Suppose you try to sneak over to dummy by playing your \ST. West will jump up with \SK, then lead another which you must win with your \SA. No entry.

In hindsight the answer is simple. Win the very first \S trick with your \SA. That leaves dummy with the \S Q J and a sure entry. It seems strange to win a trick with a higher card than necessary but it is the only way to make this contract.

The 5 loser count isn't actually right because at this point you can dump one of those losers on dummy's \HQ. The question is: Which one?

You have two chances to set up an extra winner - if the \Ds split 3-2 or if the \CK is with East. If you discard the \CQ right now you will be pinning all your hopes on the \D split. By discarding a \D instead you keep both possibilities alive.

So discard the \D. Pull trumps with \S A J (it takes two rounds) then play \DA and \DK. Bad news, East shows out. So now you take your second chance. Enter dummy with a trump and play a \C, finessing East for the \CK. Good news, this works. Two chances are better than one.

You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then click on BID. [BID 1\H]

You have an easy 1\H opening bid.

Partner responds 2\D. What is your next bid? [BID 2\H]

No matter how much you learn about bidding you will always come across hands which defy you to find anything reasonable to say. This is one of them.

You can't pass. Partner's 2-level response forces you to bid again. You can't raise his bid to 3\D with only 3-card support. You shouldn't rebid your \H suit without 6 of them. And you hate to bid 2NT with your black suit holding. Whenever you get into a situation like this you should admit to yourself that whatever you say is going to be a lie, then try to find the bid that is likely to get you into the least amount of trouble.

In this case that bid is 2\H. Although you only have 5 of them, at least you have the top 3.

After all that worrying partner bids 4\H and you pass.

South plays 4\H. West leads the \SQ and the defense plays three high \Ss.

If the trumps split 3-2 you are going to make 11 easy tricks.

So you ruff the third \S and play \HA, \HK. East shows out.

Decide whether to revise the Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Don't change plans, the old one was doing fine. Pull one more trump with the \HQ. That leaves West with \HJ and you with \H7. Don't panic, just don't lead any more \Hs. Start playing \D winners, then \C winners. Let West ruff with his \HJ any time he wants to, your \H7 will then be able to take care of a \S return and let you get back to minor suit winners.

With 10 points you aren't strong enough to respond at the 2-level, particularly with that weak \D suit.

So you bid 1NT. Partner jumps to 3\S.

What do you bid? [BID 4\S]

Your 10 points are looking better now that you know partner has at least 16. That puts you at game-going strength.

You have one loser to get rid of. Your best approach is to establish a \C in dummy to take care of your \D loser. You can't pull trumps yet because you need  the \SQ as an entry.

Win the \HA. Play a \C to the \CK, then another \C. A defender will probably win this one and they will take two \Hs. But then they must give you the lead. You enter dummy with the \SQ and dump your \D6 on the good \C. Then you pull trumps and claim.

With 11 points and a beautiful 6-card suit this is the perfect hand for a Weak-2 opener. So you open 2\D. Partner responds 2NT. [BID 3NT]

Partner's 2NT bid is a standard response to a Weak 2-bid. You are expected to rebid your suit if you have a minimum (6-8 point) hand. Otherwise you are to bid an outside suit in which you hold a high card - this is called "showing a feature". And the final possibility is this one, where you have a solid suit,  either A K Q x x x or A K J T x x. In this case you bid 3NT.

North would play 3NT.

Winner count: \S 2 : \H 1 : \D 3 : \C 1 : Total = 7

The \S lead assures you of two tricks in the suit. So you only need to create two more. If the \Ds split 3-2 (likely) you could get 3 extra tricks there. But there's a danger - if they split 4-1 you wouldn't have an entry to them. Well, you wouldn't have an entry unless you DUCKED the first \D. Then a 4-1 split wouldn't prevent you from making 5 \D winners.

So you win the \SA and lead the \D3, planning to duck. 

West shows out.

Make PLAN B, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

West shows out.

That's tough. No matter how you play them you can only get 3 \D winners. So you must turn elsewhere - elsewhere being the \C suit.

Win the \DQ but don't play another \D yet, you need an entry back to dummy later. Instead, lead the \C2 and finesse your \CT. West will win with one of the high \Cs and probably return a \S. You may as well take the \SQ now. Play your \D8 to dummy's \DK, cash the \DA, then play the \C4, finessing your \CJ. Fortunately this wins and when you cash your \CA both defenders follow. The rest of your clubs are good and you make an overtrick.

When the \Ds turned out to be 5-0 you had to get lucky. Your back-up Plan wasn't likely to work - it required the missing \C honors to be split, but also required a 3-3 \C split, not a likely outcome.

You might consider setting up dummy's \S suit for a discard but there are too few entries to make that work.

More promising is playing East to have at least one of the \D honors and taking two finesses in that suit. BUT, entries are still a problem. You can only reach dummy twice, once with the \CA and once with the \HQ, and you must play \Ds each time you are there.

Win the first trick with the \CA and play the \DJ, letting it ride if East doesn't cover. West will win this trick and take two \Cs. He will probably then lead a \S. You win your \SA, play \HA then a small \H to dummy's \HQ. Now lead a \D and finesse with your \D9. When this wins, pull trumps and claim.

Winner count: \S 0 : \H 3 : \D 4 : \C 4 : Total = 11

It's pretty clear which suit you have to worry about! Your goal is simple, you must win one \S trick before you lose two. So the crux of your problem is: Who holds the \SA and \SQ?

If West has both of them you are guaranteed to win the first trick no matter what you play.

If East has both of them you are going to lose the first two tricks no matter what you play.

The problem is to decide what to do if they are split. The answer relies on psychology, not on probability. West has made an attacking lead. But if you were West would you start out leading a low \S from a suit like \S A 9 7 3? That would be incredibly foolhardy, you would probably lead a different suit and save your \SA for catching something high from declarer. On the other hand you would be quite likely to lead a small card from \S Q 9 7 3. 

Your PLAN should be to play low in dummy and win your \ST if East withholds the \SA.

But you can also bid any other suit and it will have the same invitational quality to it, but it will give partner the information about where you could use some help. This is called a Help Suit Game Try. In this case you bid 3\C.

Partner, with 9 points and help for \Cs, bids 4\H.

South plays 4\H. West leads the \CJ.

Losers: \S 2 : \H 1 : \D 1 : \C 0 : Total = 4

The \SA and the \HA definitely won't go away. And the \D loser is pretty sure also. However, the second \S loser can be eliminated either by leading up to the \S K Q 5 or by ruffing it in dummy.

Suppose you win the \C and play one round of trumps. Oops, it is now too late to make the contract. Someone can win the \HA and play another \H. Then, whoever takes the \SA can lead a third \H and you can no longer ruff your \S.

Try this instead. Win the \C in dummy and play a small \S to your \SQ. Assume West wins the \SA and leads \HA and another \H. You win this in your hand, play \SK and ruff your last \S with dummy's last trump. Now get to your hand, pull trumps and give up a \D at the end.

Suppose when you led toward your \SQ it held the trick. Would you be convinced that East musthold the \SA and change your plan? Would you then pull trumps and let your contract depend on that assumption? I hope not.}

You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then click on BID. [BID 1\C]

With 14 points and only one biddable suit this was a snap. You open 1\C. Partner responds with 1\S. What do you bid? [BID 1NT]

This one isn't such a snap. You sure cannot support \Ss with only 2 of them, even good ones. You aren't supposed to rebid your \Cs without a 6-card suit. You hate to bid Notrump with neither of the two red suits stopped, and you cannot pass. So you bite the bullet and say 1NT. Partner jumps it to 3NT and you pass, hoping he can stop the red suits.

South plays 3NT. It turns out partner can't stop \Hs either and the defenders reel off 4 \H tricks, then lead a small \D.

Winners: \S 2 : \H 0 : \D 2 : \C 3 : Total = 7

You need 2 more tricks and you expect to get them from \Cs. This should have been evident while they were leading all those \H winners so you would not have discarded one of the \Cs from your hand. But you also had to be careful not to discard even one of dummy's \Cs, you need all three of them.

If the \Cs split 3-2 it wouldn't matter, but if East happens to have \C J x x x then you will need dummy's third \C to make a finesse. You first play your \CA, then lead a small \C to dummy's \CK. West shows out on this \C so you know that East has \C J 9 left. You lead dummy's \C7, finessing East out of the \CJ.

You have 23 points. You must open 2\C.

Partner responds 2\D showing 7 or fewer points.

What do you bid? [BID 2\S]

Following partner's negative response you merely bid your suit at the cheapest level.

You bid 2\S and partner jumps to 4\S.

Now what do you say? [BID pass]

Partner's first response told you he has a weak hand. It didn't suddenly turn into T or 11 points. Partner is merely pulling a "He Who Knows, Goes" bid. He thinks you belong in 4\S.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 3 : \D 0 : \C 1 : Total = 4

It is possible (but not probable) that \Cs will split 3-3. 

It is possible (one chance out of two) that East holds the \HA. You could pull trumps, ending in dummy, then lead toward your \HK.

It is almost certain that you could ruff your \H loser in dummy, but only if you play a \H at trick two, leading away from your \HK. The defenders will win the \H cheaply and probably play a trump. You win dummy's \SA and play another \H which they also win. They lead a second trump which you win in your hand. You now ruff the last \H with dummy's \SJ, return to your hand, pull trumps and claim.

If instead you decide to lead a \S to dummy's \SJ and lead a \H toward your \HK you might go down. West could win the \HA and play a second trump. When you played the next \H West would win again and play a third round of trumps. You would no longer be able to ruff the \H loser.}

You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then click on BID. [BID 4\H]

One school of thought says to open 2\C with a hand that is within one trick of game, even though the point count is below 22.

Another school of thought says to go ahead and bid the game, hoping to keep the opponents away from any competition.

Today you take the second and bid 4\H.

Losers: \S 3 : \H 0 : \D 0 : \C 1 : Total = 4

You are going to lose the \C for sure, so you need to find a way to hold the \S losers to 2. The obvious possibility is for West to hold the \SA and you lead through him to make the \SK a winner. That's a 50% possibility.

But you can improve on that a little bit. If West holds both the \S Q J you could make a deep finesse of dummy's \ST and East would have to play his \SA to win the trick. And if it didn't work and East won with a lesser \S you would still have time to play toward the \SK.

Win the \D, pull trumps, lead the \S3 to dummy's \ST.

You must modify the Plan a little bit. Now your only hope is that West still holds the \SJ. So you win the next trick in your hand and lead a \S toward dummy's \ST. This time West is caught. He plays the \SJ hoping you had a doubleton, but you still have a \S to get to the now high \ST.}

You've already lost 1 \S, you can't escape the \C and it looks like the \H is unavoidable also. So that means you can't afford to lose that second \S.

If you play dummy's \H4 East will win the \HK and play another \H. You will lose that second \S and go down 1.

Instead you should rise with dummy's \HA, play \DA, \DK and then a small \D which you ruff. Now play your \S9 and ruff with dummy's last trump.

Winner count: \S 2 : \H 0 : \D 1 : \C 5 : Total = 8

The good news is that they didn't lead a \H. The bad news is that if you give up the lead they probably will. 

Assuming the \Cs behave you need to get one more winner. It's possible you could lead toward dummy's \DQ but even if it works they would probably attack \Hs. Your best chance of getting an extra trick lies in the \S suit.

It is almost certain that West holds the \SQ. Of course defenders sometimes don't lead according to the guidelines, but if East had the \SQ he would likely have played it at the first trick. In addition, the Rule of 11 tells you there were 6 cards in the North, East and South hands higher than the \S5. You can account for all of them, so West must have the \SQ. In that case you can assure the contract by winning the first trick with the \SK rather than the \ST. In this way you will be able to gain a trick by finessing West for the \SQ. It's true that if you won with the \ST you would still have both the \SK and \SA remaining, but you wouldn't have the dummy entry you needed.

Notice how strange this game can be. If your holding was \S K 2 rather than \S K T you would have had no difficulty coming up with the correct play. But the fact that you can win a cheap trick with the \ST tries to lure you into making an inferior play. }

Losers: \S 0 : \H 1 : \D 2 : \C 1 : Total = 4

To start with, you ruff the third \D. You cannot avoid the \C loser, so you might think that \Hs must break evenly to give you a fourth \H trick. In fact, there is a chance that you might ruff the fourth \H.

Play exactly two rounds of trumps with the \SA and \SK. Then play \HK, \HA and \HQ. If both defenders follow to three leads your fourth \H is good so you pull the last trump. If somebody shows out on the third lead and does not ruff then play your last \H and ruff in dummy. Return to your hand with the \CA and pull trumps.
