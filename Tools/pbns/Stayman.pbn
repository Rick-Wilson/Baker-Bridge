{North opens 1NT. What do you respond? [BID pass]



If partner has a 4-card \H suit to match yours you could revalue your hand and add a point for your doubleton \S. That would give you the 9 points you need for an invitational response.

It is far too risky to play for that possibility. So you just pass.}

Partner has the wrong Major. Now that you know there is no 8-card Major fit you must go to notrump. And since you don't have the strength to insist on game you say 2NT which is an invitation for partner to bid 3NT if he has a maximum.

He has a maximum and he bids 3NT.}

Partner hit your suit. When you add a point for your doubleton \C you are up to 10 points. This is the situation where you have to use your judgement, either to invite or to bid the game yourself.

There is really no right or wrong here, between 3\S and 4\S. Those extra T's and 9's swing you to 4\S. As you see it will be a close call, but even if you misguess the \D finesse you will still establish a \D winner for a discard.}

You have a very big hand. Enormous. But you also have two 4-card Majors, so the first step is Stayman. You bid 2\C and partner replies 2\D. What do you bid next? [BID 6NT]



You have 18 points and partner has 15, 16 or 17. Your total is between 33 and 35. You have enough POINTS for a small slam, not enough for a grand. You have no Major suit fit, and are happy to play notrump.

You need to describe your hand clearly to partner with this bid. You want to show a game-forcing hand (11 points or more) with 4 \Hs and 5 \Ss. You do that by now jumping to 3\S.

Even when you hold a 6-card Major, if you have 4 cards in the other Major you use Stayman. Partner answers 2\S. What do you bid? [BID 4\S]

You've found an 8-card Major fit and you know there are enough points for game. So you bid 4\S.

Yes, but you already knew you had an 8-card \H fit since partner's 1NT promised at least 2 \Hs. In fact, you could play game in either Major. However, it is often better to play in a 4-4 fit rather than a 5-3 or 6-2. This hand shows why. Played in \Hs you will make exactly T tricks with any opening lead. Played in \Ss you will again make T tricks when the defenders start with their 3 \C winners. If they start with anything else you are very likely to make 1 or 2 overtricks by discarding dummy losers on your \H suit.}

With partner showing no 4-card Major the bidding takes a turn. With your 6 \Hs you are sure of an 8-card fit in the suit. With 11 points you must be sure of reaching game. So you bid 4\H.

In this case the strong hand does not become declarer, but the contract is the right one anyway.}

Your hand revalues to 16 points now that you know there's a \S fit. So certainly you want to be in slam as long as there are not two quick \C losers. At this point you might try something like a 4\D cue bid, hoping partner will read that as a slam try in \Ss, but denying the \C control. But that seems awfully easy to be misunderstood.

{North opens 1NT and East overcalls 2\D. What do you say? [BID 3\D]



Dad-burned interfering opponents. You were going to bid a Stayman 2\C and now you can't. You also don't want to bid either Major with only 4 of them. And you certainly can't bid notrump with no \D stopper. Fortunately the overcall has opened a window of opportunity for you. So you cue-bid 3\D. Even if you and partner haven't discussed this it is pretty obvious that you don't really want to play in \Ds, so the most likely action for him is to bid a suit, and a Major suit would have priority. So really, the cue-bid achieves the same purpose as Stayman would have.

Partner now bids 3\H. What do you say? [BID 4\H]



Partner showed a 4-card \H suit. With your 4 that makes a fit. You have 12 revalued points so you bid 4\H.}
