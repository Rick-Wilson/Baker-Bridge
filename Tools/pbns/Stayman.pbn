North opens 1NT. What do you respond? [BID pass]



If partner has a 4-card \H suit to match yours you could revalue your hand and add a point for your doubleton \S. That would give you the 9 points you need for an invitational response.

It is far too risky to play for that possibility. So you just pass.}

You have 9 points and a 4-card Major. Just enough for an invitational Stayman sequence. You bid 2\C and partner answers 2\S. What do you bid next? [BID 2NT]



Partner has the wrong Major. Now that you know there is no 8-card Major fit you must go to notrump. And since you don't have the strength to insist on game you say 2NT which is an invitation for partner to bid 3NT if he has a maximum.

He has a maximum and he bids 3NT.}

Of course you bid 2\C. Partner now bids 2\S. What is your next bid? [BID 4\S]



Partner hit your suit. When you add a point for your doubleton \C you are up to 10 points. This is the situation where you have to use your judgement, either to invite or to bid the game yourself.

There is really no right or wrong here, between 3\S and 4\S. Those extra T's and 9's swing you to 4\S. As you see it will be a close call, but even if you misguess the \D finesse you will still establish a \D winner for a discard.}

Partner doesn't have a 4-card Major so your side doesn't have an 8-card Major fit. Therefore you will play in notrump. And with your 12 points you MUST play in game. So you bid 3NT.}

Stayman bidding can be very straightforward. Partner has 4 \Ss, you have 4 \Ss. That makes 8. Partner has 15-17 points, you have 11-12 points. That makes 26-29.

You bid 4\S.}

You have a very big hand. Enormous. But you also have two 4-card Majors, so the first step is Stayman. You bid 2\C and partner replies 2\D. What do you bid next? [BID 6NT]



You have 18 points and partner has 15, 16 or 17. Your total is between 33 and 35. You have enough POINTS for a small slam, not enough for a grand. You have no Major suit fit, and are happy to play notrump.

There is a lot to be said for bidding 6NT immediately. You could ask for Aces if you like but whether partner shows one or two isn't going to change your decision. Be bold.}

What with your singleton \S you certainly have enough points for slam. But since it's possible partner has only one Ace you check with Blackwood. Partner says 5\H and you say . . . What? [BID 6\H]

This may go against your instincts, but if you're going to play Stayman then you should follow the rules. Granted that you have a great \S suit, you also have 4 \Hs. And when you have a 4-card Major you use Stayman. You bid 2\C and partner says 2\H. What do you bid now? [BID 4\H]



That is why you used Stayman - to uncover a 4-4 Major suit fit. Having done so you know that you will play in \Hs and you have enough points to bid game. You bid 4\H.}

Yes, this is the same hand as Deal 8. Again you bid 2\CThis time partner says 2\D. What do you bid now? [BID 3\S]



You need to describe your hand clearly to partner with this bid. You want to show a game-forcing hand (11 points or more) with 4 \Hs and 5 \Ss. You do that by now jumping to 3\S.

If partner had just 2 \Ss he would have bid 3NT. Since he has 3 \Ss he bids 4\S.}

Even when you hold a 6-card Major, if you have 4 cards in the other Major you use Stayman. Partner answers 2\S. What do you bid? [BID 4\S]

You've found an 8-card Major fit and you know there are enough points for game. So you bid 4\S.

Yes, but you already knew you had an 8-card \H fit since partner's 1NT promised at least 2 \Hs. In fact, you could play game in either Major. However, it is often better to play in a 4-4 fit rather than a 5-3 or 6-2. This hand shows why. Played in \Hs you will make exactly T tricks with any opening lead. Played in \Ss you will again make T tricks when the defenders start with their 3 \C winners. If they start with anything else you are very likely to make 1 or 2 overtricks by discarding dummy losers on your \H suit.}

Just like the previous deal with a 4-card Major you use Stayman. This time partner says 2\D. Your turn again. [BID 4\H]



With partner showing no 4-card Major the bidding takes a turn. With your 6 \Hs you are sure of an 8-card fit in the suit. With 11 points you must be sure of reaching game. So you bid 4\H.

In this case the strong hand does not become declarer, but the contract is the right one anyway.}

You certainly do not pass. Partner's Stayman bid tells you he has a 4-card Major suit. His 3NT bid tells you the suit was not \Hs. Elementary, Watson, the suit must be \Ss. So you convert the 3NT bid to 4\S.

Wow! Start thinking slam, but first things first. Find the suit by starting with Stayman. You bid 3\C and partner replies 3\S. What do you say next? [BID 6\S]



Your hand revalues to 16 points now that you know there's a \S fit. So certainly you want to be in slam as long as there are not two quick \C losers. At this point you might try something like a 4\D cue bid, hoping partner will read that as a slam try in \Ss, but denying the \C control. But that seems awfully easy to be misunderstood. We suggest an immediate 6\S.

With 12 points and a 4-card \S suit this fits the model for Stayman.

But thinking a little further, with this 4-3-3-3 distribution you have no ruffing values whatsoever. So even if partner also has 4 \Ss there might not be an advantage in playing the suit contract. So for this specific distribution you ignore your 4-card Major and just bid 3NT.}

Pass, then "Thank you partner" when dummy comes down. The thing to remember is that partner is in charge. You describe your hand as well as you can and then sit back and let him make the decisions. Perhaps you would have doubled if you held his hand but he didn't.}

Dad-burned interfering opponents. You were going to bid a Stayman 2\C and now you can't. You also don't want to bid either Major with only 4 of them. And you certainly can't bid notrump with no \D stopper. Fortunately the overcall has opened a window of opportunity for you. So you cue-bid 3\D. Even if you and partner haven't discussed this it is pretty obvious that you don't really want to play in \Ds, so the most likely action for him is to bid a suit, and a Major suit would have priority. So really, the cue-bid achieves the same purpose as Stayman would have.

Partner now bids 3\H. What do you say? [BID 4\H]



Partner showed a 4-card \H suit. With your 4 that makes a fit. You have 12 revalued points so you bid 4\H.}
