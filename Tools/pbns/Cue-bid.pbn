Pass. Partner indicates a minimum hand and you don't have enough extra to bid more.}

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID pass]

[show NS]

You have a pretty good hand and if partner has a limit raise or better you should bid 4\H. 

But partner doesn't have a limit raise - if he did he would have cue-bid. So you pass. }

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 3\S]

[show NS]

You would have bid 2\S if East had not overcalled. 

Instead, with 4 trumps you can jump to 3\S as a preemptive measure. Partner will not mistake this for a limit raise since you would have cue-bid with 11+ points and support.

The jump to 3 is based on the Law of Total Tricks - bidding to a trick level equal to the number of your side's trumps.}

Partner has a limit raise or better  in \Hs, 11 points or more. 

You, however, have a bare-bones minimum. So you rebid a minimum 3\H, which partner passes. }

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 2\H]

You have 14 points in support of \Ss; however, partner's overcall does not promise more than 9 points or so. 

So you cue-bid 2\H, showing a good hand with support and forcing partner to bid again. Partner bids 3\S. What do you say? [BID 4\S]

[show NS]



4\S. Partner's jump shows a good overcall, but not enough strength to insist on game when you might have only 11 points. You have plenty extra so you bid the game.}

There is only one thing you want to know now - how many Aces partner holds. So you bid 4NT to find out. Partner responds 5\H. What do you say? [BID 6\S]

You know you have a loser. Bid 6\S. }

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 2\C]

You have 12 points in support of \Hs; however, partner's overcall does not promise more than 9 points or so. 

So you cue-bid 2\C. Since the opponents have bid two suits you can cue-bid either one of them, so you usually pick the one you have the most strength in. Partner bids 2\H. What do you say? [BID pass]

[show NS]



Pass. Partner had a minimum overcall so he made a minimum rebid.}

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say, then click on BID above. [BID 3\C]

You have about 15 points in support of \Hs so you cue-bid 3\C, showing a limit raise or better and forcing partner to bid again. Partner bids 4\H. What do you say? [BID 5\C]

[show NS]



5\C. Partner's jump shows a good hand and you have more than you have promised so far. This cue-bid is a different type, showing first round control in \Cs, Ace or void. That was apparently what partner wanted to hear since he went right to slam.}
