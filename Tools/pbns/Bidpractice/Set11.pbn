SOUTH has both Majors and planned on bidding 1

first, (up-the-line).

But EAST's overcall gave SOUTH the opportunity to bid both Majors at the same time! Since the

Negative Double promises both Majors it was like SOUTH could bid 1

♠.

NORTH has ♠s so she bids 1♠, showing a minimum opener.

SOUTH has 13 points and the ♠ fit so he bids game.}

SOUTH doesn't have four cards in either Major, but with a

NORTH happily bids 3NT.}

SOUTH would have responded 1

NORTH has good

Compare this with Deal 8.

SOUTH has 7 points, barely enough for a 2

But when EAST puts in the ♠ bid, SOUTH can jump to 3

as a preemptive

measure. He knows NORTH won't think he has strength because he did not make a Support Cue-bid.

NORTH does know it and passes 3

NORTH has the strength for a raise to game in ♠s, but this could be dangerous since SOUTH

SOUTH in fact had a pretty good overcall so he jumps to 3♠ and NORTH bids the game.

With a weak overcall SOUTH would have just returned to 2♠ which NORTH would pass.}
