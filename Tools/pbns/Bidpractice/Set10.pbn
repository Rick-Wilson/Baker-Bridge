NORTH has an opening hand, 15 points, and a 5-card ♠ suit. Unfortunately WEST beat her to

the punch by opening 1

.

But NORTH should get into the bidding anyway, by Overcalling 1♠. This shows a good ♠ suit

and somewhere between 9 and 16 points.

SOUTH has 6 points. If NORTH had actually OPENED 1♠, SOUTH would be obligated to bid. But knowing that

the Overcall will not be made with more than 16 points, SOUTH just passes.}

SOUTH has an opening hand, 15 points and five ♠s. But EAST beat him to the punch,

so he overcalls 1♠.

NORTH has 11 points, and if SOUTH had opened she would make a Limit Raise to 3♠.

But when replying to an Overcall, the strength needs to be a little higher. In Deal 1 it was OK to

pass a 1♠ Overcall with 6 points, here it is correct to just raise to 2♠ with 11 points.

SOUTH actually has a strong Overcall so he bids 4♠.}

NORTH should Overcall 1♠. This shows a good ♠ suit

SOUTH has 13 points. If NORTH had actually OPENED 1♠, SOUTH would insist on game. But NORTH didn't

Open, she just Overcalled. So SOUTH must be more cautious. He jumps to 3♠ and NORTH shows her

minimum type hand by passing.}

SOUTH has 15 points, a singleton in the opponent's suit and 4-card support for any suit

partner might name. In other words, a perfect Takeout Double.

NORTH needs to make a medium-strong bid to apprise SOUTH of her 10 points. She jumps to 2♠.

SOUTH's hand is now worth 17 points because of the singleton. Since he is quite happy with

♠s he bids 4♠.}

NORTH has 14 points, a doubleton in the opponent's ♠ suit and at least three cards in

SOUTH has a really awful hand. He has just one point and his only 4-card suit is the one the

opponents have already bid. He wants nothing more than to pass.

But he cannot pass. Partner's Double said "Bid your best suit.", so he bids 2♣.

Mercifully NORTH also passes.}

NORTH has 13 points so she bids 2♣. This is an artificial bid, apprising SOUTH of NORTH's opening

hand strength, and forcing the partnership to reach the game level.

SOUTH sugggests

NORTH doesn't like

SOUTH agrees with ♠s and bids game, 4♠.}

SOUTH now bids 2♠. By doubling first, then bidding his own suit,

he shows a good suit and 17+ points.

NORTH raises to 4♠.}

SOUTH has 18 points, a balanced hand, and a good stopper in their suit. He should overcall 1NT.

For 1NT overcalls, the range is increased to 15-18 points.

NORTH bids 2♣ (Stayman), just as she would with a 1NT opening. When SOUTH denies holding

a 4-card Major NORTH has enough points to bid 3NT. She doesn't worry about a ♠ stopper

since SOUTH promised he had the suit controlled.}

NORTH has better than a minimum overcall so she accepts the invitation and bids 4♠.}

There is only one reason that SOUTH should not overcall with 1♠. He is too strong.

The maximum strength of an overcall is 16 points. Above that you should double.

So SOUTH doubles, and after NORTH bids 2♣, SOUTH bids 2♠. This shows an overcall

type hand, but with 17 or more points.

NORTH has fine trump support and 8 points so she bids a confident 4♠.}

If West had passed, NORTH would have opened with a preemptive 3♠.

She should make the same bid with the same hand AFTER the opponents open. And she makes it

for the same reason, to describe her hand and to take away bidding space from the opponents.

SOUTH treats it just like a Preemptive 3-bid, even though it is now called a Weak Jump Overcall.

In this case, SOUTH passes.}

SOUTH has 12 points, but with two 5-card suits worthy of an overcall. There isn't really a

right and wrong here, but it usually works out best to overcall in the higher-ranking suit. That

leaves open the possibility of bidding the second suit later.

everybody should pass.}

SOUTH obviously has to pass when EAST opens 1♠.

NORTH has a reasonable Takeout Double. She hopes SOUTH will name a suit and they can just

You should almost always bid when partner makes a Takeout Double. Almost always. This is the one time

when you don't. SOUTH's ♠ are so good that he passes, converting the Takeout Double into a
