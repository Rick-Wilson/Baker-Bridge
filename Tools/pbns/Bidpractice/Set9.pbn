NORTH's 2NT response is Jacoby - a game forcing ♠ raise.

SOUTH's 3NT bid shows extra strength, a 5-card trump suit and no singleton/void. This is

definitely NOT a suggestion to play Notrump - the trump suit is already agreed as ♠s.

NORTH cannot make any positive move, so she bids 4♠ which SOUTH passes.}

NORTH should not be tempted to use Jacoby 2NT with this hand. There are only 12 points, and

the Limit Raise is a perfect way to show a 12 point support hand.

SOUTH has more than enough strength to bid game after NORTH's limit raise. If NORTH had
