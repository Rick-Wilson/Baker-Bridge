SOUTH's 3♠ supporting bid is enough to convince NORTH to make a slam try.

NORTH bids Blackwood 4NT. If SOUTH shows one Ace NORTH plans to bid 6♠, but

SOUTH only needs to know one thing - how many Aces in the NORTH hand.

When NORTH opens 1NT, point-count alone tells SOUTH that 6NT can surely be made.

NORTH is bound to hold at least two Aces. But SOUTH doesn't want to miss a Grand slam.

SOUTH bids 4♣, (Gerber), and NORTH admits to just two Aces.

So SOUTH settles for the small slam.}

Blackwood tells her that SOUTH has two Aces.

SOUTH will have a thirteenth trick somewhere among his opening hand points.

Yes, this has nothing to do with Gerber or Blackwood, but everything to do with smart bidding.

SOUTH has a 16 points and NORTH has 15, 16 or 17. SOUTH wants to be in 6NT if NORTH has 17,

but merely a Notrump game if she has 15 or 16.

The way to find out is to bid 4NT - not Blackwood but merely an invitation to bid 6NT.

In this case, NORTH has but 15 points and declines the invitation. If her
