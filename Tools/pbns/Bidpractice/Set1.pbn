NORTH has a perfect 1NT opener; a balanced hand with 16 points.

SOUTH has 7 points; he knows that the most points the partnership could hold is 24 (7 + 17).

Since this is below the 26 point game requirement he passes.}

{[show NS]
SOUTH has an ideal 1NT opening -

16 points and balanced distribution.

With 12 points, NORTH knows the partnership total is between 27 and 29, enough for game

but not enough to think about slam. Since NORTH also has a balanced hand she bids 3NT.}

{[show NS]
NORTH has 16 points and balanced distribution.

She naturally opens 1NT.

SOUTH has 14 points and balanced distribution so he does the math.

The partnership has at least 29 points (14 + 15).

The partnership has at most 31 points (14 + 17).

Since this is more than the 26 needed for game, but fewer than the 33 needed for slam

SOUTH just bids 3NT, knowing NORTH will respect his decision and pass.}

NORTH has a maximum 17 point 1NT opener.

SOUTH has 9 points:

- if NORTH has 15 the total is 24, not enough for game.

- if NORTH has 17 the total is 26, enough for game.

Since SOUTH doesn't know what to do he passes the buck back to NORTH

by bidding 2NT; this is an invitation for NORTH to bid game.

NORTH has a maximum 17 point hand so she accepts the invitation.}

[Result ""]
{[show NS]
With 9 points NORTH is unable to decide the final contract. If SOUTH has 17 points then the partnership

should be playing 3NT. If SOUTH opened with just 15 points then 3NT will be too high..

So NORTH makes the temporizing bid of 2NT. This tells SOUTH that he must make the final call - go on to

game if he has maximum, pass if he has minimum. On this Deal SOUTH has 17 points so he bids 3NT.}

SOUTH has 9 points; he knows that the partnership is somewhere between

NORTH, with a minimum, declines the invitation by passing.}

{[show NS]
SOUTH has a strong hand, 20 points and balanced distribution.

It is just right to open 2NT (20-21 points).

NORTH adds her 2 points to SOUTH's promised number of 20 or 21. Since she doesn't reach the

magic game number of 26 points she just passes.}

{[show NS]
NORTH has an mid-range 1NT opener; a balanced hand with 16 points.

SOUTH has 9 points. He bids 2NT, asking NORTH to pass if she has 15 or bid 3NT if she has 17.

But NORTH has 16 points, which leaves her with no clear choice.

In this case she must decide whether her hand is a "good" 16 points or a "poor" 16 points.

Since her supporting cards are mostly 10's, 9's and 8's she figures it as "good"

and bids 3NT.}

{[show NS]
The partner who is first sure what the final contract should be should just go ahead and bid it.

This is called "She who knows, goes."

In this deal, for example, it is NORTH who knows. She has a balanced 14 points, so when SOUTH indicates

20/21 points with his opening 2NT bid she

KNOWS

the partnership holds about 34/35 points.

Therefore she

GOES

to 6NT.}

This is another example of "She who knows, goes."

NORTH has a solid 18 points, (1 extra for the fifth Club), so when SOUTH opens 1NT

she

that together they must hold at least 33 points. The may even have 35 points.

In any case they should be in slam, so NORTH

After SOUTH passes initially, NORTH opens 1NT.

With 9 points, SOUTH has invitational strength, so he says 2NT.

NORTH has a small problem - SOUTH's bid tells her to bid 3NT with 17 points, but to pass

with 15 points. Her problem is that she has 16! Since it looks to her like a "good" 16 points

she bids 3NT. If those 10's and 9's had been 4's and 3's she would have passed.}

NORTH has a great 1NT hand - 17 points and 4-3-3-3 shape.

SOUTH has 16 points; he figures it is possible that NORTH can make a slam, but only

if she has a 17 point opener. So he bids 4NT, expecting NORTH to bid 6NT if she has 17 points

but to pass if she has fewer.

He figured right - NORTH had 17 points so she bid 6NT.}

NORTH definitely does NOT have a balanced hand. She has two doubletons and a

6-card Club suit.

But she DOES have 18 points, (two extra for the fifth and sixth Clubs), and her 18 added to

SOUTH's minimum of 15 is enough to bid 6NT.

Notice how easy this will be to play once that Club suit is established.}
