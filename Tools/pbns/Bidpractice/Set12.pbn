SOUTH is unlikely to win 10 tricks if NORTH has three ♣ losers.

SOUTH's 3♣ bid is a Help Suit Game try.

With no help in ♣s and no ruffing values, NORTH's 8 points are

not enough to think of game, so NORTH signs off in 3

NORTH cannot rebid the 5-card ♠ suit, cannot support SOUTH's

So she bids 3♣, New Minor Forcing, asking SOUTH to describe his hand further.

SOUTH doesn't have three ♠s, nor does he have four

s.

But he does have

s stopped, so bids 2NT. North is not strong

enough to bid game so she passes.}

NORTH has a perfect hand on which to use Fourth Suit Forcing. If South can stop

♠s, then 3NT would be a great contract.

There is one problem - if NORTH bids 1♠ at her second turn it is NOT considered

FSF, so she must jump to 2♠.

SOUTH, win a fine ♠ stopper, bids 3NT.}

SOUTH's 2

bid is a perfect example of NMF.

first priority.}

NORTH's 1♠ bid is definitely forcing, but it is not FSF. In this one instance, all

NORTH could make a Help Suit Game Try in either ♠s or ♣s.
