SOUTH has an ideal 1NT opening -

With 12 points, NORTH knows the partnership total is between 27 and 29, enough for game

but not enough to think about slam. Since NORTH has no 4-card Major suit she bids 3NT.}

With 6 points, SOUTH must respond to NORTH's 1♣ opening bid.

While it is often correct to respond by bidding suits "up-the-line", SOUTH should

skip over the weak

suit in favor of showing the 4-card

Major ♠ suit.

NORTH knows that SOUTH may only have four ♠s, but with four of her own she can support the

suit. Since she has a minimum opening bid she merely raises to 2♠.

With his minimum response hand SOUTH passes.}

SOUTH has a powerful hand, but 21 points is not strong enough to start with a forcing 2♣ bid.

SOUTH's response is based on simple math. He adds his 18 points to the 15 minimum that NORTH has announced and

comes up with 33 points combined. This is enough for a small slam, and since he has balanced distribution

he bids 6NT.}

SOUTH is right at the maximum for a 1♠ opening bid - one more point and he would

NORTH does not have 3-card ♠ support but with 7 points must make some response.

NORTH has a minimum 1♠ opening bid - 13 points and five trumps. She doesn't even suspect

what's about to befall!

SOUTH hears the 1♠ bid and all he wants to know is whether NORTH has one, two or three Aces.

So he uses the Blackwood convention, 4NT.

NORTH has two Aces so she bids 5

5

SOUTH has heard enough and bids 6♠.}

SOUTH has a maximum 17 point 1NT bid.

NORTH, with 16 points, can't tell if there are enough points for slam. If SOUTH has

17 points then a slam should be makeable, but if SOUTH has only 15 points then he

should settle for game.

The 4NT raise solves the problem. It tells SOUTH to bid 6NT with 17 points, pass

with 15 points, and use best judgment with 16. Here SOUTH bids the slam.}

Usually, no matter what your strength, when you have five cards in the Major suit that your partner opens
