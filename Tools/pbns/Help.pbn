There is no doubt that you could use some help in \Ds. But you need more than that, you need points. This hand isn't good enough to invite to game so you pass.}

This is not a great hand by any means. If partner had invited with a 3\S bid you might have passed. But he invited with a 3\H bid, asking if you can Help him take care of losers in that suit. And you have loads of Help. Not only do you have a high honor but you can ruff the third round. So you bid 4\S.}

You might make a Help Suit Game Try in \Cs, but with 19/20 points in your own hand you should just bid the game yourself. So you bid 4\S.}

[PLAY S:D6]



Partner is inviting you to bid game, and your 8 points are right in the "judgement" area.

But he has asked you to use judgement based on your \D holding, which is awful. So you sign off at 3\H. }

The bidding has gone as shown. Decide what you would say next, then click on BID above. [BID 3\C]



You are almost strong enough to bid the game right now, but you are worried about \Cs. If partner can Help out in that suit you'd be willing to try for 10 tricks. So you make a Help Suit Game Try of 3\C. Partner replies 3\H. What do you say next?  [BID pass]

[show NS]



When you ask partner to make a judgement call and he does so, you don't then override that call. You pass.}

[show NS]



You have an invitational strength hand, but there are TWO suits you could use some help in. In this case you pick the suit where the Help would be most welcome. If partner can Help in \Ds that will probably be all you need to make game.

So you bid 3\D and partner puts you right to 4\S.}

[show NS]



Partner has invited you to bid game and you have 10 points, an absolute maximum. But, he has also told you he is worried about \Cs and your help in that suit is rather nebulous.

Since you have to make a judgement one way or the other you should decide that a Queen is a little bit of Help and with the 10 points that should be enough. You bid 4\H.}

Except for the \S weakness you have a nice hand. If partner can Help you in that suit then you want to be in game.

So you bid 2\S and partner bids 4\H. Sometimes it is easy.}

[show NS]



You do have 9 points so you are inclined to bid game, but partner needs help in \Ds, and you are bankrupt there. But rather than just signing off, this hand gives you a way to temporize.

You bid 3\H, a bid not covered in the Summary, but which you hope partner will interpret as meaning: "I can't help you in \Ds, but I have some great \Hs."

Apparently partner interpreted it the way you wanted since he bid the game.}
