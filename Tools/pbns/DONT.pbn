With 10 HCP and 10 red cards you have a good enough hand for an immediate DONT bid. So you bid 2\D, promising that suit and a Major.

Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid now? [BID pass]

[show NS]



Don't get carried away, partner isn't really bidding a \H suit as much as he is letting you know he doesn't like \Ds. You were only competing for a partscore and here you are in a partscore. You pass.}

OK, you only have 4 HCP. But you have 10 cards in the Majors. And, you are in the balancing seat. If East is willing to let it die at 1NT your partner must have some strength. So you should use DONT. Youbid 2\H, showing both Major suits.

Partner responds 2\S. What do you bid now? [BID pass]

Partner prefers \Ss to \Hs. Since you were bare minimum you pass.}

Your hand is too balanced to intervene over East's 1NT so you pass.

Then partner overcalls 2\D. What do you bid now? [BID pass]

[show NS]



Partner has two suits, \Ds and one of the Majors. If his other suit is \Hs then a 2\H bid by you would work great. But if his other suit is \Ss anything you say would not be good.

Since you can tolerate \Ds your safest call is pass.}

In the balancing seat it is distribution that counts, not point count. With a 6-card Major suit and a singleton you should not let them play 1NT. Youdouble.

Partner makes the relay bid of 2\C. What do you bid now? [BID 2\H]

You don't have a 6-card suit, nor do you have a 5-4 pair of suits. So even with a singleton you don't want to use DONT here. So you pass.

Partner makes a DONT double in the balancing seat. What do you bid now? [BID 2\C]

[show NS]



Right now you probably have a premonition about what is going to happen next. But there really is nothing you can say other than 2\C.

Your premonition came true. Partner passes and you are left playing 2\C with a singleton. Nobody promised that DONT would always get you to a good contract.}

You only have 8 HCP but with such a good 6-card suit you should interfere with a DONT bid. You double and partner surprises you by saying 2\H.

What do you bid now? [BID pass]

[show NS]



There is a reason partner didn't say 2\C (which you were going to pass). And the reason is that he figures you will be better off in his \Hs. Since you trust your partner you pass.}

Since partner has entered the bidding in the immediate seat he should have a pretty good hand, with 9+ cards in \Hs and \Ss.

Usually you are happy to settle for partscore after a DONT sequence, but with such an excellent fit for \Hs your hand is worth a raise.

So you bid 3\H and partner says 4\H.}

You would have opened 1NT but East beat you to it. You cannot double for penalties when you use DONT, so you pass.

[show NS]



The 2\S bid shows a weak hand, with more strength partner would have first doubled, then bid 2\S.

Still, you know he has a 6-card suit and you also know that every finesse is going to work. You either bid 3\S or 4\S. Be bold.}
