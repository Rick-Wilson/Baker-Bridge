But it doesn't tell you what to do when you have 16 points. So you have to make a judgement about your hand. Is it closer to 15 or closer to 17? The answer is definitely ""closer to 17"". Aces are actually worth a little more than 4 points and you have three of them. Also, most of your spot cards are higher than average, with only one card below a 7. So you bid 3NT.\nSouth plays 3NT.

[NEXT]\nDon't let that Question Mark by the !H losers mislead you - if you are going to make this contract you cannot lose a !H trick at all!Is there any hope? [NEXT]\nThe odds aren't good, but you actually have TWO possibilities for success. If West holds the singleton !HK, you can play a small !H to dummy's !HA, dropping the !HK, then finesse East out of his !HJ. Or, if East holds the singleton !HJ you can play your !HQ, finessing West for the !HK and at the same time smothering East's !HJ.\nWhich basket will you put your eggs into? [NEXT]\nThe answer is simple Bridge math!East started with 6 !Ss leaving him 7 cards outside the !S suit. West started with just 1 !S, leaving him with 12 cards outside the !S suit. Obviously East is much more likely to have a singleton !H than West.\nSo you win the !CA in your hand, play the !HQ and let it ride if West does not cover.\nThen you click NEXT to see how things turned out. [NEXT]\nBut to tell the truth, the Bridge math wasn't really complete. Distribution-wise it was just fine, but there is also the question of strength.\nThe fact that East overcalled makes it more likely that he holds more high cards than West, and this skews the odds toward East holding the !HK.\nBut think about it. If East does in fact hold the singleton !HK, and if you cleverly drop it by playing dummy's !HA it won't help you. You will then have to lose a trick to West's !HJ."

[NEXT]\nSuppose you win the !HA, play over to the !CQ, then try to get back to your hand with a trump to discard 2 losers on !C A K. If it worked that way it would be fine, but it is very likely that a defender would win their trump Ace, then take their 2 !Hs and 3 !Ds. You could be down one before you even got started.\nA better approach is to trade one of your !C winners for a quick discard. Take the !HA, then play  !C A K, discarding a !H from dummy. That will eliminate one !H loser. [NEXT]\nYou probably cannot avoid your 3 !D losers, but you may be able to get out with losing a single trump. IF !Ss split 3-2, and IF you can win tricks with both the !SK and !SQ then you will make it. The only way it can happen is if East holds a doubleton !S A x. You must play the first !S from dummy, so ruff a !C to get there, then lead a small !S, putting on your !SQ when East follows low. This wins the trick, (hip-hip), so you now play your !S3, ducking in dummy. When East has to take his !SA, (hooray), you are home-free.\nClick NEXT to see the full deal. [NEXT]\n[RESET]\nBut, if you need East to hold the !S A x anyway, perhaps that first plan would have worked better. You know, take dummy's !CQ, then play a low !S to get to your hand. \nIt depends on East. If he ducked the low !S then you could get TWO discards and make an overtrick.\nThe method given here gives up the possibility of an overtrick for an improved chance of making the contract. You choose."

[NEXT]\nThat's why it's good to have second thoughts at the Bridge table. Think about the meaning of the !S8 lead. If it is fourth down, then the Rule of 11 tells you that there will be 3 cards higher than the 8 spread among North, East, and South. BUT YOU CAN SEE 4 HIGHER CARDS. So your conclusion is that West has NOT made a fourth-down lead, but rather has led top-of-nothing, top-of-a-doubleton, or perhaps a singleton.\nYou don't know which of the above, but you do know that East holds both the !S K J. The danger is if the !S8 is a singleton and you play low from dummy they could get a !S trick and a !S ruff. So don't play low from dummy.

Since your minor suit hopes require that BOTH of them work, your best bet is the double !S finesse.

[NEXT]\nIf it comes to a squeeze it is important to take your tricks in the correct order. First take 4 !C tricks, discarding the !SJ from your hand. You note that East discards a small !S on the fourth !C.\nNext take 4 !H winners, discarding dummy's useless !S6 and keeping all 4 !Ds.

Everybody passes and you stare in amazement at partner's 16 points.\nWouldn't it have been funny if partner had thought your 4!C bid was Stayman? And so his 4!H bid would have been showing a suit. And then your 4NT bid would have been Blackwood. And then he would have answered 5!D and you would have passed and made it!"

Not much figuring is needed, it must come from the !D suit. Since you are missing 5 cards including the Queen, the odds favor a finesse over playing for the drop. And, since you have the option of finessing either defender are you going to finesse into the one who can set you or into the safe one?\nSilly question.
