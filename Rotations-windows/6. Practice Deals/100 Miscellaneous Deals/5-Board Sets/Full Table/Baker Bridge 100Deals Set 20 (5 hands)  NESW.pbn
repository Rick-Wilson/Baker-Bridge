{You are North and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You have 23 points. You must open 2\C.

Partner responds 2\D showing 7 or fewer points.

What do you bid? 

Following partner's negative response you merely bid your suit at the cheapest level.

You bid 2\S and partner jumps to 4\S.

Now what do you say? 

Partner's first response told you he has a weak hand. It didn't suddenly turn into T or 11 points. Partner is merely pulling a "He Who Knows, Goes" bid. He thinks you belong in 4\S.

North plays 4\S. East leads the \DQ.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 3 : \D 0 : \C 1 : Total = 4

It is possible (but not probable) that \Cs will split 3-3. 

It is possible (one chance out of two) that West holds the \HA. You could pull trumps, ending in dummy, then lead toward your \HK.

It is almost certain that you could ruff your \H loser in dummy, but only if you play a \H at trick two, leading away from your \HK. The defenders will win the \H cheaply and probably play a trump. You win dummy's \SA and play another \H which they also win. They lead a second trump which you win in your hand. You now ruff the last \H with dummy's \SJ, return to your hand, pull trumps and claim.

If instead you decide to lead a \S to dummy's \SJ and lead a \H toward your \HK you might go down. East could win the \HA and play a second trump. When you played the next \H East would win again and play a third round of trumps. You would no longer be able to ruff the \H loser.}

{You are East and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

One school of thought says to open 2\C with a hand that is within one trick of game, even though the point count is below 22.

Another school of thought says to go ahead and bid the game, hoping to keep the opponents away from any competition.

Today you take the second and bid 4\H.

East plays 4\H. South leads the \DQ.

Losers: \S 3 : \H 0 : \D 0 : \C 1 : Total = 4

You are going to lose the \C for sure, so you need to find a way to hold the \S losers to 2. The obvious possibility is for South to hold the \SA and you lead through him to make the \SK a winner. That's a 50% possibility.

But you can improve on that a little bit. If South holds both the \S Q J you could make a deep finesse of dummy's \ST and North would have to play his \SA to win the trick. And if it didn't work and North won with a lesser \S you would still have time to play toward the \SK.

Win the \D, pull trumps, lead the \S3 to dummy's \ST. 

You must modify the Plan a little bit. Now your only hope is that South still holds the \SJ. So you win the next trick in your hand and lead a \S toward dummy's \ST. This time South is caught. He plays the \SJ hoping you had a doubleton, but you still have a \S to get to the now high \ST.}

{You are South and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You are very weak. But you are also not vulnerable.

So with 5 playing tricks you leap to 3\H. Partner raises to 4\H and you pass.

South plays 4\H. West leads \SA, then \H8.

Losers: \S 2 : \H 1 : \D 0 : \C 1 : Total = 4

You've already lost 1 \S, you can't escape the \C and it looks like the \H is unavoidable also. So that means you can't afford to lose that second \S.

If you play dummy's \H4 East will win the \HK and play another \H. You will lose that second \S and go down 1.

Instead you should rise with dummy's \HA, play \DA, \DK and then a small \D which you ruff. Now play your \S9 and ruff with dummy's last trump.

But you don't want to get into the habit of doing what is USUALLY good without thinking through the consequences.}

[Result ""]
{You are West and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

With a balanced, 17 point hand you open 1NT. Partner responds 2NT. What do you bid? 

You were invited to bid 3NT if you have a maximum opener. With 17 points you accept the invitation.

West plays 3NT. North leads \S5. You put on dummy's \S6 and South plays the \S8.

Winner count: \S 2 : \H 0 : \D 1 : \C 5 : Total = 8

The good news is that they didn't lead a \H. The bad news is that if you give up the lead they probably will. 

Assuming the \Cs behave you need to get one more winner. It's possible you could lead toward dummy's \DQ but even if it works they would probably attack \Hs. Your best chance of getting an extra trick lies in the \S suit.

It is almost certain that North holds the \SQ. Of course defenders sometimes don't lead according to the guidelines, but if South had the \SQ he would likely have played it at the first trick. In addition, the Rule of 11 tells you there were 6 cards in the East, South and West hands higher than the \S5. You can account for all of them, so North must have the \SQ. In that case you can assure the contract by winning the first trick with the \SK rather than the \ST. In this way you will be able to gain a trick by finessing North for the \SQ. It's true that if you won with the \ST you would still have both the \SK and \SA remaining, but you wouldn't have the dummy entry you needed.

Notice how strange this game can be. If your holding was \S K 2 rather than \S K T you would have had no difficulty coming up with the correct play. But the fact that you can win a cheap trick with the \ST tries to lure you into making an inferior play. }

{You are North and it is your bid. Decide what you would say, then  on BID. 

You have a nice hand, but can only open 1\S.

Partner raises to 2\S. What do you bid? 

Partner has 6-10 points, you have 20 points.

The math works so you bid 4\S.

North plays 4\S. East leads the \DT, you cover and West plays the three high \Ds.

Losers: \S 0 : \H 1 : \D 2 : \C 1 : Total = 4

To start with, you ruff the third \D. You cannot avoid the \C loser, so you might think that \Hs must break evenly to give you a fourth \H trick. In fact, there is a chance that you might ruff the fourth \H.

Play exactly two rounds of trumps with the \SA and \SK. Then play \HK, \HA and \HQ. If both defenders follow to three leads your fourth \H is good so you pull the last trump. If somebody shows out on the third lead and does not ruff then play your last \H and ruff in dummy. Return to your hand with the \CA and pull trumps.

By pulling exactly 2 rounds of trumps first you can also succeed in the case where \Hs split 4-2 and the defender with the doubleton \H also has a doubleton trump.}
