{Partner has about 11 points and he has no 4-card Major suit.

He thinks 3NT would be a good spot. You have no reason to disagree so you pass.

West plays the \HJ and you duck, hoping he will switch to any other suit!But of course he doesn't; he continues with the \H4.

You need three more winners. You can get them in \Cs by just driving out the \CA. The danger is that EW might win the \CA and 4 \H tricks. Or, you can get them in \Ss if West holds the \SK, a 50% chance. 

You should try to avoid 50% chances when you have something better. Consider the chance that EW will actually be able to win 4 \H tricks if you give them the lead with the \CA. In particular notice that you were dealt the \H2! If East's \H3 is a fourth down lead then he cannot have anything smaller and the \Hs are splitting 4-4.

Knowing they can only take 3 \H tricks makes it safe for you to drive out the \CA. 

So win the \HA and drive out the \CA. They will take their 2 \H tricks next. If West then leads a \S DO NOT FINESSE. Take your nine tricks and run.

While the answer may depend on the opponent, usually you should take their opening lead at face value. After all, their main goal is to give information to their partner, not to deceive you. }

Who knows whether you should use a transfer or just bid 4\H yourself. Assume you decide on the transfer and bid 2\D. Partner bids 2\H (of course). What do you say now?

Naturally you go ahead and bid 4\H, the final contract.

The contract would be 4\H played by East.

To make West the declarer  ROTATE. 

West plays 4\H. North leads the \SQ and South follows with the \S9.

You win the first trick with the \SA.

The loser count is very confused, but that \C suit is not confused at all. You want to be able to run the \Cs so your plan is to play the \H A K, and if both defenders follow go ahead and knock out the last \H so they can't ruff your \C tricks.

Unfortunately when you play \H A K, North plays the \HQ, then discards a \S. 

You may think you should change your plan but you should go right ahead with it. South has two master trumps, but dummy still has 4 small ones. So play a \H to force out South's \HT. He will no doubt play another \S and force dummy to ruff. No problem, knock out South's final \H and dummy will still have one tiny trump left. When you get back in you can run the \Cs unimpeded.

The exception is when you have a long suit you wish to run and you can't stand to have the running stopped by a ruff.

This Deal is unusual in that there are two master trumps, but the principle is the same.}

[Result ""]
{The 2\S bid is used as a transfer to 3\C.

If you don't use this in your system, just consider this hand; you might decide to incorporate it. So you bid 3\C and everybody passes.

West leads the \HJ.

You play dummy's \HQ hopefully, but East plays the \HK.

That is one loser too many. The \CQ MIGHT drop . . . but she won't. There are no finesse positions. So you are going to have to establish a winner somewhere to discard dummy's small \S. 

Do you see it? The \H8. Take the \HA. Then play your \C A K. As predicted, the \CQ doesn't fall. Then play a small \H to dummy's \H9. Of course West will take the \HT, but now your \H8 is high.

As soon as you get the lead you play the \H8 and discard dummy's \S2. 

The real reason for covering was so you could establish the \H8 by force.

Suppose you had not played the \HQ to trick one. East would have withheld the \HK and you'd have had to take your \HA. Later East would have taken dummy's \HQ with his \HK, then played a small \H through your \H8 to West's \H T 7.}

You could either use a transfer or you could jump to 3\S. You decide on the transfer and bid 2\H. Partner jumps to 3\S! What do you say now?

The 3\S bid is a "Super-accept", showing a maximum 1NT opener, 4 \Ss and a doubleton. In other words, partner's hand has revalued to 18 points. So you bid 6\S (or you could ask for Aces instead).

The contract would be 6\S played by West.

To make East the declarer  ROTATE. 

East plays 6\S. South leads the \CQ, North follows with the \C2.

You win the first trick with the \CA in your hand.

There are two obvious possibilities for avoiding the \H loser. You could finesse North for the \HK; this is a 50% chance. The \Ds could split 3-3; this is a 36% chance.

In fact, your chances are better than either of those percentages because you can try the \Ds first, and if they DON'T split you can then try the \H finesse. 

Pull trumps; South shows up with 3 trumps. Play the \DK, then a small \D to dummy's \DA. On this trick South follows with the \DT.  

Your contract just became a sure thing!Play the \CK to strip both your hands of \Cs. Lead dummy's last \D,  and when North plays low, finesse the \D9. If the finesse wins, discard a \H from dummy on your good \D. But if the finesse loses to South's \DJ, he will be endplayed and have to lead a \H into your \H A Q or give you a ruff/sluff with a \C. And on top of that your fourth \D will be good. 

But imagine that the \DJ is transposed to the South hand. He wins that \D trick but must give you the contract with his return.}
