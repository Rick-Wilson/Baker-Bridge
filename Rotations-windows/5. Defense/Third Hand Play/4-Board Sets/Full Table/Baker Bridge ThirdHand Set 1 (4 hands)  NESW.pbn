{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \S2, dummy played the \S3 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

This is a perfect example of why you should USUALLY play Third-hand-high.

If you do not put your \SQ on this trick declarer will get an undeserved winner with his \SJ. In this Deal it will be his ninth trick. Play Third-hand-high and he will go down, otherwise he will make his contract.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \HQ, dummy played the \H4 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

You dare not play low for fear declarer might win a singleton \HK.

And when you win the first trick, (the \HK does NOT fall), you have to decide what to do next. Do not just return the suit like a robot since it is obvious that you have no more \H winners and you surely won't win any \C tricks.

You need to switch to a \D, and the \D4, (low from an honor) is recommended.

Played this way you will defeat the contract by one trick. If you allow declarer to win the first trick he will pull trumps and discard two red losers on dummy's \C and make an overtrick.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \C4, dummy played the \C3 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

But that doesn't mean you should blindly play your HIGHEST card, rather you should play the LOWEST of high-equals.

In other words, in this case you should play the \CJ, which is equal to the \CQ.

If instead you play the \CQ, figuring it makes no difference, you'd be right that it makes no difference to you. But partner would then assume that it is declarer with the \CJ, and when he obtains the lead with the \DK he will be unlikely to lead another \C, which would be too bad for your side.}

[Result ""]
{The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \S3, dummy played the \S4 and it is your play.

When you have made your choice  

Partner's low \S lead tells you that he has an honor in the suit. There are only two \S honors you can't see, and you know he wouldn't underlead an Ace at a suit contract. So partner holds the \SQ.

You can see clearly what would happen if you played Third-hand-high and put on your \SK. Declarer would win his \SA and could then set up a second \S trick by leading toward dummy's \SJ.

By playing the \ST you force declarer to win with the \SA if he wants the trick. But however he plays he can only make one \S trick when you play correctly.

For your side, 2 \S tricks and the two minor Aces spell defeat.}
