{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \SK, West played the \S7 and North the \S5.

What do you play to the second trick?

When you have made your choice  

You can see the \S6, \S5, \S4, \S3 and \S2. So the \S7 is West's lowest \S, he is doing his best to discourage you from leading the suit again.

North held up with \S A J x, hoping you would play the suit again and give him two tricks.

If you play the \DT West will win the \DA and return a \S, allowing you to drive out North's \SA while you still have the \CA for an entry.}

{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \SK, East played the \S7 and South the \S8.

What do you play to the second trick?

When you have made your choice  

You cannot see the \S5. The most likely reason is that East has it, and his \S7 is an encouraging signal. The only reason he would encourage you is if he held either the \SA or \SJ.

Together, you two continue to play \Ss to drive out South's \SA. When you get the lead with your \CA you will cash your \S winners and East will still have the \DA for some icing on the cake.

There IS another possibility if South is a better than average Declarer. East just might hold \S 9 7, giving South \S A J 8 5. South played the \S8 as a falsecard to tempt you into playing the suit again. This isn't too likely, but if it happens just congratulate South for the fine play.}

Much better to play low. Partner will surely switch to a \D, and North will probably finesse, though it doesn't matter whether he does or not. You will win the \DK, return the \C9 back to East's \CK, and still have your trump trick for later.}

When you have made your choice  

You might just switch suits, but you have a better choice.

If you play your \SQ, East won't bother ruffing, South WILL ruff and dummy's \SJ will be established as a winner.

The best procedure is to lead a low \S. East will ruff and South will over-ruff but by playing this way you stop the establishment of North's \SJ. As you can see, South would have been able to discard a loser on that \SJ if you hadn't played this way.}

North now plays the \DJ on which East plays the \D2. What do you play now, and what is your plan.

When you have made your choice  

South hoped his \D suit would provide enough tricks to make the game. You can see that there is no entry to the South hand EXCEPT in \Ds, so you want to win your \DA on the trick that North plays his last \D. How can you tell which trick that is?

Only by watching what East plays. On the \DJ East played the \D2, a low card signaling that he held an ODD number of \Ds. ODD must be either one or three so when he followed to the next \D you know he started with three. A little bit of counting tells you that North started with the doubleton Jack, so you want to win the second \D trick.

This defense holds North to one \D tricks, if you had let him win the second one he would have had 9 tricks. }

When you have made your choice  

You really want East to lead a \C if he gets into the lead. If you discard the \C9 East will surely get the message and will lead a \C. BUT - you will only win 3 \C tricks. The \C9 would have been the fourth winner.

So instead, play a low card in one of the other suits, say the \D3.

North is one trick short and he sees he can easily get that trick in \Hs. So he plays a second \H from dummy and you now discard the \S2. East takes the \HA and he can see that you don't want him to lead a \S or a \D. He deduces that you might like a \C so he plays his \C2 and you win 4 tricks.}

East looks at your signal, then looks at dummy, then looks at your signal. He knows you want a switch and it looks like a switch to \Cs might work the best. North plays a low \C from dummy, you win the \CJ. Next you play a low \D, taken by East with his \DK. East leads a \C. Dummy plays the \CK, you win that, cash another \C, then cash your \DQ.

When you have made your choice  

West will look at your \C9 and perhaps think for an instant that you want him to play another \C.

But it will be a short instant because a look at dummy makes in absolutely clear to everybody that playing another \C could not help your side. Dummy has so many trumps that repeated \C leads would do nothing.

OK. If it's not an encouraging Attitude signal, what is it? Suit preference of course. Since it is a high spot card you are asking West to switch to the higher suit (choosing between \Ds and \Hs).

West dutifully plays a \H and you take the next three tricks. Had he switched to a \D instead, South would have been able to discard one of his \H losers on North's \DQ.}

{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \CA. Seeing your \C3 he next played the \DA. What will you play on this trick?

When you have made your choice  

Normally with this holding you would play the \D9 to encourage East to play a second \D through dummy's \D Q T.

But this time you really want him to take his \CK. So play the discouraging \D2 and hope he gets the message to go back to \Cs. If he does play the \CK next it will win and he can then give you a \C ruff.}

{You are East. The bidding has been as shown. Partner led the \H5, you put on the \HJ, South won with the \HA. The second trick was \DA, \D2, \D3, \D5. The third trick was \DJ, \D6, \D8, \D7. South then put the \CQ on the table.

When you have made your choice  

Does it look to you like South is trying to create an entry to dummy so he can cash the 2 \D winners? That's what he wants it to look like, hoping someone holds up their \CA.

But don't believe Declarer, believe your partner. On the first \D West played the \D2. On the second \D he played the \D6. He has an odd number of \Ds, obviously 3. And South must also have a third one, so he is up to some trickery with that \CQ.

So grab your \CA and return partner's \H suit. }

{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. The 2\H bid was a transfer. The 5NT bid meant to choose either 6\S or 6NT. North liked the suit. Partner led the \S5, won by North's \SQ. North pulls one more trump with his \SA, then wins three high \Ds. Next comes dummy's \HA on which he plays the \H3 and East plays the \H9. Then he leads dummy's \H6 which you win with the \HQ. On this trick North drops the \HJ and East the \H2. It is your play.

When you have made your choice  

If you believe North is now out of \Hs then you shoud not play your \HK because it would give him a ruff-sluff.

But you shouldn't believe North when your partner has sent you a clear signal that he holds an EVEN number of \Hs. In this case an even number must be 4 which means that North has one more \H. So you play your \HK. He ruffs in dummy of course, but then has no way to get rid of that \C loser when the finesse fails.

If you had not been paying attention to East's signal you might have decided to risk a \C lead - with a disastrous result.}

{You are West. The bidding has been as shown. You led the \CA, East played the \C2 and South the \C9. What should you play to the second trick?

When you have made your choice  

On first thought East's \C2 seems to be a discouraging signal. Think again.

After the first trick you know the location of every \C except the \CQ and \CJ. If East started with \C J 2 he would have signaled with the \CJ. If East started with \C Q J 2 he would have signaled with the \CQ. Since he did neither he started either with singleton \C 2 or with \C Q 2. In either case you should play a low \C now which he will either win with his \CQ or he will ruff.

It turns out that he wins with the \CQ, then leads a \S back to your \S A Q.}
