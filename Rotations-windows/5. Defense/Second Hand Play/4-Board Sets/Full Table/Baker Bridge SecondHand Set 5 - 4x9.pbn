{You are West. The bidding has been as shown.

East led the \SK, won by North's \SA. North played a small \C to dummy's \CA, then led dummy's \HJ.

What do you play? \HQ or \H4? 

When you have made your choice  

Remember that North opened 1\H, so he has 5 of them. With only 3 trumps out he has no intention of finessing. Perhaps he led the \HJ just to tempt you to cover in this situation.

If you play low he will win with one of his high \Hs and then you will have a sure \H winner. Along with the \S winner East has you will defeat the slam.

If you cover the \HJ with your \HQ North will again win with one of his high ones. But now the position will be clear to North and he will return to dummy and play another \H, finessing your \HT. With no trump loser he will make the slam. }

{You are South. The bidding has been as shown.

You decide a trump lead is called for and lead the \H2. Your partner wins with the \HA and plays the \DJ. East lets this go to dummy's \DK, (but you know he has \DQ), then plays a trump back to his \HK, pulling the 2 outstanding trumps from South and North.

East's next play is the \S3 from his hand. Do you play your \SA or not?

When you have made your choice  

Even if East doesn't have the \SK he can establish a \S winner just by leading twice toward the \S Q J. That winner will take care of whatever black-suit loser he may have.

If North has a \C trick it is important to get it established soon. So go up with the \SA and play a \C through dummy's \C A Q. When East tries the \S suit again NORTH can win and cash his \CK for the setting trick.

If you play low on East's \S play North will be forced to win the trick and he cannot profitably attack the \C suit from his side.}

[Result ""]
{You are East. The bidding has been as shown.

Partner led the \H3, you play \HT and South wins the \HA. South pulls the last two trumps by leading low to dummy's \HQ. He now calls for the \S6. Will you play your \SA or not?

When you have made your choice  

When a singleton in dummy is led through your Ace it is more often better to play low than to go up with the Ace. Declarer might not even have the King, or he may have the King Jack combination and guess wrong.

Here it works out best to play low even though South has the \S K Q 5.

Assume you play your \SA. South will play his loser, of course, and later will be able to discard two of dummy's \Ds on the \S K Q. He can then ruff his two \D losers and make the contract.

Now assume you play low. South will play the \SQ which will win the trick and he will no longer have a \S loser. BUT - now he will have no way to dispose of the two \D losers and will go down 1.}

{You are North. The bidding has been as shown.

You lead the \DJ and dummy's \DA wins the first trick. Declarer pulls trumps with dummy's \SK, then his \SA. He then plays his \DK and follows with \CQ, \CK and \CA, discarding a \H from his hand on the last.

With all that completed West plays the \HA. What do you play?

When you have made your choice  

It may look foolish to waste your \HK but look what will happen if you don't. West will follow up with another \H and when you win the \HK you will be forced to play a minor suit. Since both East and West are out of \Ds and \Cs you will be giving them a ruff-sluff and the contract.

But if you dump your \HK under West's \HA look at what's left. West has \H losers and when he plays a \H from either hand South will scoop up two tricks with his \H Q T.}
