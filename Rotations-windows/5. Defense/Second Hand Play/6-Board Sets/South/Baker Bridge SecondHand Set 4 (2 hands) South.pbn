{You are East. The bidding has been as shown.

Partner led the \H3, you play \HT and South wins the \HA. South pulls the last two trumps by leading low to dummy's \HQ. He now calls for the \S6. Will you play your \SA or not?

When you have made your choice  

When a singleton in dummy is led through your Ace it is more often better to play low than to go up with the Ace. Declarer might not even have the King, or he may have the King Jack combination and guess wrong.

Here it works out best to play low even though South has the \S K Q 5.

Assume you play your \SA. South will play his loser, of course, and later will be able to discard two of dummy's \Ds on the \S K Q. He can then ruff his two \D losers and make the contract.

Now assume you play low. South will play the \SQ which will win the trick and he will no longer have a \S loser. BUT - now he will have no way to dispose of the two \D losers and will go down 1.}

[Result ""]
{You are West. The bidding has been as shown.

You lead the \DJ and dummy's \DA wins the first trick. Declarer pulls trumps with dummy's \SK, then his \SA. He then plays his \DK and follows with \CQ, \CK and \CA, discarding a \H from his hand on the last.

With all that completed South plays the \HA. What do you play?

When you have made your choice  

It may look foolish to waste your \HK but look what will happen if you don't. South will follow up with another \H and when you win the \HK you will be forced to play a minor suit. Since both North and South are out of \Ds and \Cs you will be giving them a ruff-sluff and the contract.

But if you dump your \HK under South's \HA look at what's left. South has \H losers and when he plays a \H from either hand East will scoop up two tricks with his \H Q T.}
