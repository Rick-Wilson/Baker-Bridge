{It is possible your side can make 3NT on this deal. You have 9 points, invitational strength, and your \D stopper is excellent.

However you should look for an even bigger reward by doubling. South is in serious trouble, and when the opponents make a mistake you should punish them.}

{Partner's 2NT bid requests that you bid 3\C, so you do. He next says 3\D.  

Partner's bid is game-forcing Stayman, but with a \D stopper (SLOW SHOWS). Holding 4 cards in each Major you bid up-the-line, 4\H. Partner now bids 3NT. What do you say? 

Partner would not have asked for a 4-card Major unless he held one himself. Since it wasn't \Hs it must be the other one. You bid 4\S.}
