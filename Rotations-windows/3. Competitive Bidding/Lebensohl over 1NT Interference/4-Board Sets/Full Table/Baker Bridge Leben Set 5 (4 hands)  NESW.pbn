{With 9 points you don't want to sign-off with 2\H. But you aren't strong enough to force to game with a 3\H bid either. So you start an invitational sequence by bidding 2NT.

Partner says 3\C. What do you bid? 

Now you bid 3\H. Partner will realize you have better than a sign-off, but were not good enough to bid 3\H immediately. He has a maximum, and he knows you have a 5-card suit, so he bids 4\H.}

{Partner's bid asks if you have 4 \Ss, and denies a \H stopper. (DIRECT DENIES)

You don't have 4 \Ss, nor can you stop \Hs. You have no choice but to bid one of the 4-card Minor suits, so you go up-the-line and bid 4\C. Partner bids 5\C.}

{It is possible your side can make 3NT on this deal. You have 9 points, invitational strength, and your \D stopper is excellent.

However you should look for an even bigger reward by doubling. South is in serious trouble, and when the opponents make a mistake you should punish them.}

{Partner's 2NT bid requests that you bid 3\C, so you do. He next says 3\D.  

Partner's bid is game-forcing Stayman, but with a \D stopper (SLOW SHOWS). Holding 4 cards in each Major you bid up-the-line, 4\H. Partner now bids 3NT. What do you say? 

Partner would not have asked for a 4-card Major unless he held one himself. Since it wasn't \Hs it must be the other one. You bid 4\S.}
