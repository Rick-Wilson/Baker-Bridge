{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

You have enough for a 1-level Overcall so you bid 1\S. Partner says 3\S. What do you say now? 

The jump raise tells you partner has 11-14 points.

With your minimum it's going to have to be better than that to get you excited. So you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You have 10 points, but in cases like this points don't matter that much. They MIGHT be able to make 4\H. Partner MIGHT be able to make 4\S. This preemptive jump takes the decision away from them.

Looking at the hands you can see that partner is going to go down 1 at 4\S. However, that is an excellent result since they appear to be cold for 5\H.}

Nice hand. But not nice enough to double, then bid your \Hs. So you overcall 1\H. Partner says 3\H. It is your bid. 

The jump raise promises 11-14 points. Your 17 plus partner's 11 or so takes you right up to game. You bid 4\H.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Partner has at least 11 points for his 2-level overcall. He might have as many as 16. You have a perfect invitational hand including two sure stoppers in their suit. So you bid 2NT. Partner raises to 3NT and you get to play it there.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

This hand would be one point too strong to Open 1NT, but it fits the 15-18 range to Overcall 1NT. Partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

Don't get your systems crossed. Partner did not make a cue-bid, he is using Stayman. Since you have no 4-card Major suit you answer 2\D. Partner now says 2NT and the ball is in your court. 

This is just a plain old 1NT/Stayman sequence. Partner is inviting, and since you have 18 points you accept.}

Wow! Great \S support and 15 points. You cue-bid 2\D, forcing partner to bid. He says 2\S. Your turn. 

Partner has not made a strong bid and it is possible that T tricks will be too high. But it is pretty likely that game can be made so you bid it. Be bold!}
