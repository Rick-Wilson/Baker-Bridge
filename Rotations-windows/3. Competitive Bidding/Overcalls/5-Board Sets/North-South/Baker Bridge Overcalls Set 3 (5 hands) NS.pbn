{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

This hand would be one point too strong to Open 1NT, but it fits the 15-18 range to Overcall 1NT. Partner responds 2\C. What do you bid? 

Don't get your systems crossed. Partner did not make a cue-bid, he is using Stayman. Since you have no 4-card Major suit you answer 2\D. Partner now says 2NT and the ball is in your court. 

This is just a plain old 1NT/Stayman sequence. Partner is inviting, and since you have 18 points you accept.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Wow! Great \S support and 15 points. You cue-bid 2\D, forcing partner to bid. He says 2\S. Your turn. 

Partner has not made a strong bid and it is possible that T tricks will be too high. But it is pretty likely that game can be made so you bid it. Be bold!}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You don't like to take partner out of his overcalled suit without good reason. Here you have good reason. So you bid 1\S. Partner replies 2\S. What do you say next? 

You expect partner to have three trumps, but he has made a minimum bid. So you take the conservative route and pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. 

You have a nice easy decision here. You overcall 1\H. Then partner bids 1\S. What do you say next? 

Whether you play a change of suit as forcing or not, your hand certainly qualifies as one where you should make a bid. Partner doesn't really like your \Hs but you are quite satisfied to play in \Ss. So you bid 2\S. Partner jumps to 4\S and that closes out the auction.}
