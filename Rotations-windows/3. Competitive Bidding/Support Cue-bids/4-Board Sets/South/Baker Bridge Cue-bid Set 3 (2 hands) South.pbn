{You have 12 points in support of \Hs; however, partner's overcall does not promise more than 9 points or so. 

So you cue-bid 2\C. Since the opponents have bid two suits you can cue-bid either one of them, so you usually pick the one you have the most strength in. Partner bids 2\H. What do you say? 

Pass. Partner had a minimum overcall so he made a minimum rebid.}

{You have about 15 points in support of \Hs so you cue-bid 3\C, showing a limit raise or better and forcing partner to bid again. Partner bids 4\H. What do you say? 

5\C. Partner's jump shows a good hand and you have more than you have promised so far. This cue-bid is a different type, showing first round control in \Cs, Ace or void. That was apparently what partner wanted to hear since he went right to slam.}
