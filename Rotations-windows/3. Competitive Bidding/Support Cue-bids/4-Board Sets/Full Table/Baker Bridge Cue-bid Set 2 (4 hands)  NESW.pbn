{You would have bid 2\S if East had not overcalled. 

Instead, with 4 trumps you can jump to 3\S as a preemptive measure. Partner will not mistake this for a limit raise since you would have cue-bid with 11+ points and support.

The jump to 3 is based on the Law of Total Tricks - bidding to a trick level equal to the number of your side's trumps.}

[Result ""]
{You have 14 points in support of \Ss; however, partner's overcall does not promise more than 9 points or so. 

So you cue-bid 2\H, showing a good hand with support and forcing partner to bid again. Partner bids 3\S. What do you say? 

4\S. Partner's jump shows a good overcall, but not enough strength to insist on game when you might have only 11 points. You have plenty extra so you bid the game.}
