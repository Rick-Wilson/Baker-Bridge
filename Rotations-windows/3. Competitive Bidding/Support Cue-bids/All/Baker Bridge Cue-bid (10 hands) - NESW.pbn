{You would have bid 2\S if East had not overcalled. 

Instead, with 4 trumps you can jump to 3\S as a preemptive measure. Partner will not mistake this for a limit raise since you would have cue-bid with 11+ points and support.

The jump to 3 is based on the Law of Total Tricks - bidding to a trick level equal to the number of your side's trumps.}
