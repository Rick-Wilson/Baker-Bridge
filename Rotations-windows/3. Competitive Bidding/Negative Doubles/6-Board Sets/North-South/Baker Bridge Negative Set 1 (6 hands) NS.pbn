{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

I admit it, I tried to trap you. Just because this is a lesson about Negative Doubles doesn't mean you should abandon your normal good bidding practices. You have a known 8-card \H fit so you don't need to bother telling partner about your two 4-card Minors. With 12 points and support you make a cue-bid in the opponent's suit which tells partner you have limit-raise or better.

Partner now bids 4\H which you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With 8 points and 4 \Hs you have enough to make a negative double. Partner bids 2\H. What do you say now? 

Partner also has 4 \Hs. Unfortunately his strength is only in the 13-15 point range. So you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You just scrape 7 points together. With your 4-card Major that's enough for a Negative Double. So you double and partner jumps to 2\S. What is your bid? 

Partner's jump is inviting but it takes more than just a simple jump to get you excited with this junk. Even though partner has 16-18 points you pass.}

Partner has indicated a 4-card \S suit. Since you also have 4 you will naturally bid them. However, with the \S fit your hand revalues to 17 points. So you jump to 2\S. Partner bids the game.}
