You have a very good hand but only 2 of partner's \H suit. You are actually too strong to just jump in \Ds so you cue-bid the opponent's suit. Partner now bids 3NT which you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Ahhh, a perfect Negative Double. Both Majors have been bid and you have 4 cards in each Minor. So you double. Partner bids 2\H. What do you say next? 

Well let's see. Partner shows no interest in your two Minors or notrump. And he has 6 \Hs and a minimum hand. He wants to play it at 2\H so you pass and let him.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Partner is showing both Minors but you are not interested in either one. Bidding notrump is a possibility but with just a single \S stopper is not advisable. With 18 points and a 6-card suit you jump in the suit. You bid 3\H and partner raises to 4\H.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

When the two Majors have been bid, a Negative Double shows both Minors. So you double. Partner now bids 3\D. What do you say next? 

This is difficult. You forced partner to bid and he supported your known \Ds. But he didn't jump so you figure him for 13-15 points. Revaluing your hand you get up to 13 points so it is just possible you have a 28 point total. That's not enough for game in \Ds so you pass.

As you can see you will lose 2 \Ss and 1 \C so you made the right decision.}
