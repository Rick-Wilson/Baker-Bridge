{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With 13 points and 4 of the "other" Major you make a Negative Double. Partner's rebid is 2\H. What is your next bid? 

Partner has 4 \Hs and an opening hand. You have 4 \Hs and an opening hand. That adds up to a game bid and an 8-card \H fit. You bid 4\H.}

Partner's Negative Double in this situation shows both Majors. You can't support either Major but with 18 points and good \D stoppers you jump to 2NT. Partner bids 3NT and everybody passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

If you bid 1\S now it would be showing a 5-card \S suit. So instead you make a Negative Double. Partner jumps to 2\S. What do you bid? 

Partner's jump shows a Medium hand, 16 - 18 points. Add your 11 and you have enough for game so you bid it.}

You have a very good hand but only 2 of partner's \H suit. You are actually too strong to just jump in \Ds so you cue-bid the opponent's suit. Partner now bids 3NT which you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Ahhh, a perfect Negative Double. Both Majors have been bid and you have 4 cards in each Minor. So you double. Partner bids 2\H. What do you say next? 

Well let's see. Partner shows no interest in your two Minors or notrump. And he has 6 \Hs and a minimum hand. He wants to play it at 2\H so you pass and let him.}
