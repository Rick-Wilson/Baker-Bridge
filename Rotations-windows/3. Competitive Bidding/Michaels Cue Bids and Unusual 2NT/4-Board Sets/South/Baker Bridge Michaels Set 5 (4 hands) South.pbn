{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

This is a really good hand for Unusual Notrump. You bid 2NT and partner says 3\S. What do you say now? 

Partner apparently has a big hand. His cue-bid is forcing, and probably means he wants to be in game. But for now you can just show your minimum strength and give a suit preference. You bid 4\C and partner raises to 5\C.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Many times at Bridge you want to fight for the contract. This isn't one of them. With 6 HCP and only four cards total in partner's two suits just let the opponents have it. You pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

With two 5-card Majors of course you bid 2\D. Partner responds 3\C. What do you say now? 

This wasn't according to your script. Partner was supposed to choose a Major. The reason he didn't, of course, is that he didn't like either one and figured you would be better in \Cs. So you pass.}

You don't have a great hand but you DO have 4 \Ss. So don't let the opponents have a 3-level contract when your side has 9 \Ss. Bid 3\S.
