{You have only 7 HCP but expect partner to have a reasonable hand since West could not keep the bidding open. With your black 2-suiter you bid the lowest one, 2\C.

Partner says 2\D.  

Partner's 2\D bid, the next suit up the line, asks you to name your other suit (or pass if your other suit is \Ds).

You bid 2\S and everybody passes.}

{You would have opened 1NT but West beat you to it. You cannot double for penalties when you use DONT, so you pass.

Partner bids 2\S in the balancing seat.  

The 2\S bid shows a weak hand, with more strength partner would have first doubled, then bid 2\S.

Still, you know he has a 6-card suit and you also know that every finesse is going to work. You either bid 3\S or 4\S. Be bold.}
