{With 16 points and a balanced hand you were planning on opening 1NT yourself.

But one of the consequences of playing DONT is that you have no bid to describe this hand. You cannot double because then partner would just bid 2\C as a relay and you wouldn't know where to go.

So you pass.}

You do bid just 2\S though, rather than a double followed by 2\S, which would show a stronger hand. Everybody passes.}

You have absolutely no preference between the two suits. But you do have a preference as to where the opening lead will be coming from - you'd like East to have to lead through West's strength. Besides you feel like playing the last hand so you say 2\S and everybody passes.}
