Since you can tolerate \Ds your safest call is pass.}

Partner makes a DONT double in the balancing seat.  

Right now you probably have a premonition about what is going to happen next. But there really is nothing you can say other than 2\C.

Your premonition came true. Partner passes and you are left playing 2\C with a singleton. Nobody promised that DONT would always get you to a good contract.}

Still, you know he has a 6-card suit and you also know that every finesse is going to work. You either bid 3\S or 4\S. Be bold.}
