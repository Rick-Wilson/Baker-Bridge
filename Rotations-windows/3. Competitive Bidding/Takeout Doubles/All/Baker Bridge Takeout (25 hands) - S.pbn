Yes, you like the \Hs. But remember, you forced partner to bid and his response showed 8 or fewer points. You are not strong enough to consider a game so you pass.}

Partner shows 9-11 points and a \S suit. However, he didn't force you to game, and you barely scraped up the double to begin with. So you pass.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You should double. This is a special case of the Takeout Double, where the opponents have already bid two suits before it gets to you. Since they apparently have at least 20 points, you should have a solid hand with at least 4-4 in the two unbid suits. A hand just like this one.

Partner bids 2\D. What do you say next? 

Just pass. This is obviously a fight for the partscore and you have the advantage because you have found a fit. However, you suspect partner is quite weak.}

Pretty good hand you have. Certainly good enough to make a Takeout Double that forces partner to the 3-level. Partner responds 3\H. What do you bid? 

Some questions don't have a correct answer. If partner has \H Q x x x along with the \CK and \DQ he would bid just as he did and slam would be cold. But if he has four small \Hs and nothing else he would bid just as he did and you probably cannot make ten tricks. On balance it is probably best to just bid the most likely reasonable contract, which is 4\H.}

You have a perfect 2NT opening hand. Trouble is, the opponents have already opened. You get around that problem by first making a Takeout Double. Partner replies 1\S.  

You could not say 1NT on your first bid because that would show 15-18 points. Doubling first, then bidding the lowest level of notrump shows 19-20 points. Of course in both cases you must have their suit adequately stopped. Partner does the math and bids 3NT.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Partner told you to bid, so you say 2\C. East repeats his suit and partner then says 2\S.  

By doubling and then bidding his own suit, partner is showing a good hand, at least 17 points. Your hand can be revalued to about 7 points so you are good enough to invite partner to game. You bid 3\S and partner says 4\S.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Now that East has stolen your response you aren't strong enough to make a free-bid at the 2-level. You pass, West bids 2\D and partner doubles again. Now what? 

This is not a penalty double, partner is merely repeating his request for you to name a suit. But now he expects you to choose between \Hs and \Cs.

You bid 3\C and everybody passes.

You may be one too high, but that still might be a good score if they can make 2\D.}

After East bids you are no longer forced to respond to partner's Takeout Double. You may pass is you want to.

But if you don't pass you are making what is called a "free bid". You should have 6 or more points and a reason for wanting to bid - like your 5-card \H suit.

You bid 2\H and everybody passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

The redouble has taken the force from you - you can pass if you want to. But if you pass, the most likely scenario is that South will also pass. So partner will either have to let them play 1\D redoubled (which will be a disaster for your side) or take out his own double by bidding some suit. So he will bid a suit and it will almost surely be 1\S.

You can help your side the most by bidding 1\H immediately. You don't have to worry that partner will believe you have a good hand; both he and South have 13+ points and North's redouble shows T or more. He knows there are no points remaining for you to have.

On this deal your \H bid gets passed around to North who bids 2\D, the final contract.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

The problem with making a Takeout Double of a preemptive bid is that the bidding for your side starts out a level or two higher. So you can't risk doubling with a flimsy hand. However, this hand is certainly good enough so you double. Partner responds 3\H. What do you bid? 

After partner cuebids the next job is to find a suit, so you bid 3\S. Partner now bids 4\C. What do you say? 

You cannot stop short of game. Partner has apparently rejected your \S suggestion. Since you are happy to play in \Cs you bid 5\C.}

You could certainly say 1NT if you wanted to. You have 8 HCP and a very good \C stopper. However, you will probably make a lot more points by letting them play 1\C doubled.

This is exactly the kind of hand you need to pass and convert partner's Takeout Double to a Penalty Double. Partner should lead a \C so you can pull declarer's trumps as soon as possible.}
