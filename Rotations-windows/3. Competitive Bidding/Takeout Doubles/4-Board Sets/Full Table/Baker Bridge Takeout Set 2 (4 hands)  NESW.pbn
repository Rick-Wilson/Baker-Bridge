{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

This is almost the hand you held in Deal 4 - just 3 points stronger in \Ds. So you double, and again partner jumps to 2\S. What do you bid? 

That extra 3 points makes all the difference. With that singleton \H your hand is now worth at least 16 points. Add partner's 9, T or 11 and you are at game level. Bid 4\S.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You'd really like to have 4-card support for both Majors when you double a Minor. But it's not a requirement. So you double and hear partner respond 2\D. North then chips in with 3\D. What now? 

Don't let North's bid bother you, he's just trying to push the envelope. You have a good hand and partner's bid shows 12+ points and is forcing to game. Now you have to find the right game, and the best way to start is by showing a 4-card Major suit. You bid 3\S.

That was what partner needed to hear, he bids 4\S.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

The minimum requirements for a Takeout Double are 12 points, no more than two of Opener's suit, and at least 3-cards in the other suits. You just squeak by so you double. Partner says 1NT and it is your bid again. 

With no suit fit you can't even count a point for your doubleton so you have just 13 HCP. Partner's bid shows 8-T so you waste no time in passing. Don't worry about the \Ss, partner says he has them covered.}

Partner is showing you 8-10 points and no 4-card \H suit.  

With no Major fit you are happy to play in notrump, knowing partner can stop their suit. Partner's 8-10 points added to your 17 is a probable game so you bid 3NT.}
