Partner shows nothing extra. All you know now is that he doesn't have 4 \Hs. You know you want to be in game, but you aren't sure which game. If partner has 3 \Hs then 4\H would be good. If not though, 3NT would be good if he has a \D stopper. The way to find out what he has is with Fourth Suit Forcing. So you bid 2\D. Partner answers with 2\H.  

Partner tells you he has 3 \Hs. You bid the \H game.}

This is Fourth Suit Forcing and partner may or may not have a \C suit. You do not have 3 \Hs. You do have a \C stopper, so with a minimum hand you bid 2NT and partner passes.}

{You are the dealer.  

You open your 5-card suit, 1\D. Partner responds 1\S.  

You might bid 1NT, but since you have a singleton you prefer to say 2\C.

Partner bids 2\H. What do you say? 

This is Fourth Suit Forcing and partner is fishing for more information. You certainly don't have 3 of his \Ss so that is out. On the other hand, you have a double stopper in \Hs, so with 14 points you go right to 3NT.}

You have a nice \D suit but don't bid it now. That would be FSF and partner would assume you didn't have a \D stopper. 

With 13 points, bid what you expect to make, 3NT. Partner passes.}

You open 1\H. As expected, partner responds 1\S.  

This is easy bidding so far. You bid your second 5-card suit, 2\C.

Partner says 2\D. What do you bid? 

Partner's bid is FSF. He wants to know if you have 3 \Ss, (you don't), or if you can stop \Ds, (you can't). So you have to rebid one of your 5-carders, and you should bid the lower-ranking one. You bid 3\C and partner raises to 5\C.}

{You have 15 points and you respond 1\S. Partner rebids 2\D. What do you say next? 

You would love to play 4\S if partner has 3 \Ss. Or, you would love partner to play 3NT if he has \Cs stopped.

So you say 3\C (FSF) to find out if either possibility exists. Partner does have \Cs stopped and bids 3NT.}

With both 4-card minors you open 1\D. Partner responds 1\S. What do you bid next? 

You cannot bid 2\H since you are not strong enough to reverse, so you bid 2\C.

Partner jumps to 3\H. What do you bid? 

Since partner jumped this is NOT FSF. Partner has a \H suit and a pretty good hand to go with it. You also have a \H suit so you bid 4\H.}

You COULD bid 3\C, FSF, to find out if partner has a \C stopper but that would be pointless. You already know of an 8-card \H fit so you say 4\H.}

You cannot support \Ss with only 3 of them. Instead you bid 2\C. Partner says 2\H.  

This is FSF, asking you to further describe your hand, and you have a problem. You do have a \H stopper so you COULD bid 2NT. You also have 3 \Ss so you COULD bid 2\S. Either way might turn out best, but that \HK looks pretty lonesome so you choose 2\S and partner raises to 4\S.}

{You respond 2\C. Partner rebids 2\D. What is your next bid? 

With 13 HCP and that \C suit you could jump to 4\C. However, that would sail you right past 3NT which is very likely to turn out your best game. Rather than rebid \Cs, find out whether partner has \Ss stopped by using FSF.

You bid 2\S and partner then says 2NT. Where do you go from here? 

It couldn't have worked out better. Notrump played from partner's side. You bid 3NT.}

You rebid "up-the-line", so you now say 1\H. Partner says 1\S. What do you bid? 

Be careful! This is NOT Fourth Suit Forcing. It is true that you are forced to bid, but the difference is that in this sequence partner has a real \S suit. With 4-card support you bid 2\S and partner raises to 4\S.}

You have \Ds stopped, and with your 13 points you might well jump to 3NT. And while you may end up at 3NT it can't hurt to find out if partner has 3 \Ss first. So you bid 2\D, FSF. 

Partner says 2\S, telling you he has three of them, and you bid 4\S.}

This is FSF, asking you to further describe your hand. Since you have 3 \Hs you will naturally let partner know that. But, your hand is so good you should jump to 3\H. Remember that partner may be bidding with only 12 points.

He was pretty weak, but with your jump finds enough to say 4\H.}
