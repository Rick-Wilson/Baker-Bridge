{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 10 points and a great 6-card suit this is a perfect Weak 2-Bid. You open 2\D. West passes and partner jumps to 4\D. East passes. What do you say? 

This is not an invitation to bid game. If partner had game interest he would bid 2NT. Apparently he is trying to preempt the opponents out of their hand and apparently it is working. You pass.}
