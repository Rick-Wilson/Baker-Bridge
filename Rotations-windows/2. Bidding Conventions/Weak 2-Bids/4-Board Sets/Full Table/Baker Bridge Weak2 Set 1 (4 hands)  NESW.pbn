{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 10 points and a great 6-card suit this is a perfect Weak 2-Bid. You open 2\D. East passes and partner jumps to 4\D. West passes. What do you say? 

This is not an invitation to bid game. If partner had game interest he would bid 2NT. Apparently he is trying to preempt the opponents out of their hand and apparently it is working. You pass.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You should pass. You have 15 points, and if partner has the maximum of 11 it seems you might be able to make a game. But your points are trashy points. What a Weak 2-bidder usually needs are Aces and Kings, while you have an assortment of Queens and Jacks. }

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

This is very solid. So you open 2\S. Partner responds 3\S. What do you say now? 

You say "pass". Partner has no interest in game since he didn't bid 2NT. This is a preemptive raise only.}
