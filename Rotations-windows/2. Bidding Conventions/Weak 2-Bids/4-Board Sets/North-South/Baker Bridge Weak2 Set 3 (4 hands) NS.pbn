{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You open with a Weak 2-Bid, 2\D. Partner responds 2NT. What do you say next? 

The 2NT bid is forcing and your suit is A K Q x x x. This is the standard guideline where you must rebid 3NT. When you do, partner passes. Nice.}

The 2NT bid is forcing and you have better than a minimum. You show your "feature" by bidding 3\C. Partner now bids the game.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

One of the characteristics of Weak 2-Bids is that Responder often is unsure how high to go. That's why the 2NT bid is such a great tool. In this case you bid 2NT and partner says 3\H. What do you say? 

Well, you weren't sure whether to take partner to game or not, so when he says he has a minimum hand you have to pass.}
