{You dealt this hand.  

You aren't strong enough to open 2\C so you bid 1\S. Partner responds 3\S. What do you say? 

Partner's limit-raise shows 11-12 points and you revalue your hand up to 22. So you are definitely in slam territory. You hope partner has 2 Aces but you cannot use Blackwood with that worthless doubleton in \Ds. Instead you make a control-showing bid of 4\C. Partner then bids 4\H. What do you bid next? 

The good news is that partner's control-showing bid says he has the \HA. The bad news is that he bypassed \Ds so he does not have the \DA. Since you may have 2 quick losers in \Ds you sign off at 4\S. }

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have a textbook 1NT opener, so you open 1NT. Partner says 4NT. What do you bid? 

THIS IS NOT BLACKWOOD. Partner's bid is the Quantitative 4NT. He has 16 points and is inviting you to bid slam if you have a maximum opener, but to pass with a minimum. Since your 17 point hand is at the top of the 1NT range you accept the invitation and bid 6NT.}

{You COULD make a Splinter Bid with this hand. You have a singleton \D and great trump support. However it is usually not worthwhile Splintering when you have the strong hand that will be taking control. Since what you really want to know is how many Aces partner has you just ask him with a 4NT bid. Partner answers 5\H. What do you bid? 

Missing one Ace you bid 6\H.}

{Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have a good hand, but not good enough to jump-shift at your first turn. So you respond 1\S. Partner now jumps to 3\S. What do you bid? 

Partner has 16-18 points and \S support. It depends on the Aces so you bid 4NT. His answer is 5\H. What do you say? 

You are missing one Ace but 6\S should be a good slam.}
