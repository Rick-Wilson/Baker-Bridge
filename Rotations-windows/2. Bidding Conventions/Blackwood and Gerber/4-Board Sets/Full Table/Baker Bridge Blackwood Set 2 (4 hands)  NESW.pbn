{Partner opens a Weak 2-bid and catches you with a blockbuster. The only thing you want to know about his hand now is how many Aces he has. So you bid 4NT. Partner answers 5\H. What do you bid? 

That makes it simple, with 2 Aces you bid a confident 6\H. If he had 1 Ace you would have bid an also confident 5\H. If he had zero Aces you would have been in a spot of trouble. And if he had 3 Aces you would have asked him how he could open a Weak-2 with that many points.}

{You MIGHT say that with 13 points and partner controlling the \Cs you could jump to 2NT, "To show you my points, partner."You might say it but you won't because your first priority is to look for a Major suit fit. You bid 1\H (skipping \Ds with the two Majors). Partner now jumps to 4\H. What do you say? 

Partner says you can make game even if you have a minimum 6 points. So he must have about 20. So you think you can make slam and you bid 4NT. Partner answers 5\H. What do you bid? 

Partner shows 2 Aces so you bid 6\H.}

{You dealt this hand.  

You have 20 points and it would not be terrible to open 2NT. However, strictly speaking you shouldn't open 2NT with two doubletons. So you open 1\D. Partner responds with a jump to 2NT. What do you bid? 

With partner's 13-15 added onto your 20, bidding 6NT would be a reasonable bid. However, it costs nothing to check for Aces first, so you bid 4\C. (Everybody agrees this is Gerber, right?)Partner answers 4\S. What do you bid? 

Easy, missing one Ace you bid 6NT.}

{You dealt this hand.  

With 13 points and a good Major suit you naturally open 1\S. Partner responds 3\H. What do you bid next? 

We are playing strong jump-shifts by Responder so partner is showing 17+ points. However, you are still stuck with your minimum opening so you just rebid 3\S. Partner bids 4NT. What is your reply? 

He asks for Aces so you bid 5\H showing 2. He now bids 5NT. What do you say? 

You have no King. So you reply 6\C and partner bids 6NT (safer than 6\S).}
