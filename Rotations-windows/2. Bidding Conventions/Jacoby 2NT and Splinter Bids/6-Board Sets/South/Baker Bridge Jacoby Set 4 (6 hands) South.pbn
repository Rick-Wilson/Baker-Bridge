{It is your bid. 

With 17 points you need to indicate a better than minimum opening. You have no singletons and just a 5-card trump suit so you bid 3NT. Partner says 4\D and it is your bid again. 

Partner's 4\D bid shows first round control (surely the Ace). You bid 4\H, showing your first round control. Partner now says 4NT. What do you bid? 

You are being Blackwooded, and with three Aces you reply 5\S. That was apparently just what North wanted to hear, so he bid 7\S.}

{It is your bid. 

You were all set to give a Jacoby 2NT response when West stuck in his 1\S overcall. Now you can't because Jacoby is off after opponents interfere. Fortunately you have another bid at your disposal. You say 2\S, showing good \Hs and a limit raise or better. Partner bids 3\H. What do you say now? 

Partner didn't have enough to bid game, not knowing if you had more than 11 points. But you know you have opening hand so you bid 4\H.}

{It is your bid. 

Partner's Splinter Bid in \Cs has really made your hand look good. With no losers in trumps or \Cs you need to find out about the other two suits. So you invoke Blackwood and partner replies 5\H. What do you bid next? 

If partner can take care of your three \C losers you will have just one \S loser at most. So you bid 6\H. Maybe you should have bid 7\H.}

{It is your bid. 

Following your Jacoby 2NT response, partner bids 3\H, showing a singleton. What is your next bid? 

Your \H holding hasn't been enhanced by partner's singleton. You feel like just signing off at 4\S but since you can show the \D control below that level you bid 4\D. It didn't matter since partner now signs off at 4\S.}

{It is your bid. 

You have a great hand, but no singleton to show. Since you have a 6-card \H suit you bid 3\H. Partner replies 3\S. What do you bid? 

Partner has control-bid the \SA. He may also have one or both of the Minor Aces since he would have bid the cheapest control first. You use Blackwood. He replies 5\D. What do you bid? 

Oops. Despite all the points you are missing two Aces. So you thank Mr. Blackwood and sign off at 5\H.}

{It is your bid. 

You don't want to make a Splinter Bid with a singleton King so you content yourself with a Jacoby 2NT bid. Partner rebids 4\D. What do you say next? 

The 4\D bid shows a 5-card \D suit. What you need to know now is how many Aces partner has. You bid 4NT and he answers 5\H. What do you say? 

He has two Aces so you bid 6\S.}
