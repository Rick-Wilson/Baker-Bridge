You have just a little extra so you bid 3\C to show a singleton. Partner says 3\H and it is your bid again. 

Partner's bid means he has first round \H control, obviously the \HA. But it also denies holding the \DA since control bids are made up-the-line. You show your lack of a Minor suit Ace by returning to 3\S. Partner signs off at game.

You could equally have just bid 4\S yourself.}

With opening hand and 4-card \S support this is an ideal Jacoby 2NT response. Partner says 3NT.  

North has some extra strength and a 5-card \S suit. This is the point in the bidding where you would make a control bid, showing an Ace. Well, you would if you actually had an Ace. The way you indicate your lack of a control is to just return the the agreed trump suit. So you bid 4\S and partner passes.}

You have an opening hand with four of partner's Major suit so naturally you want to force to game. Although you could bid a Jacoby 2NT, the presence of the singleton \S makes a Splinter Bid more attractive. So you double-jump to 3\S. Partner now bids 4\C. What do you say next? 

Partner's 4\C bid is control showing, and indicates he is thinking slammish. You bid 4\D showing your control and partner bids 6\H.

As you can see, North should make 12 tricks by discarding one \C loser on your \DA.}

When the opponents interfere, Jacoby is off. Now a cue-bid response by partner shows a hand with good trump support, and a limit raise or better in strength. So partner might have a game forcing hand, but also might have only 11 points.

 back to Deal 12 for a quick comparison between the two hands. Almost identical, but this time your singleton is the \SK. Since it is not advisable to Splinter with a singleton Ace, King or Queen you just bid 2NT instead. Partner jumps to 4\H and you pass.

Note that in this hand the three points you credited for your \SK are completely wasted. And although partner has the same hand as he did in Deal 12, this time there is no chance of making slam. This shows why you don't Splinter with singleton Honors.}
