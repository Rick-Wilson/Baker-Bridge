{It is your bid. 

You show an above minimum hand with 6 trumps by bidding 3\S. Partner bids 4\S. What do you say next? 

Partner would have shown a red Ace if he had one. Since he doesn't have one, all thoughts of slam are off. You pass.}

{It is your bid. 

With 15 points and four of partner's suit you naturally bid 2NT. Partner now jumps to 4\H. What do you say? 

Partner's rebid of 4\H is not strong. He is using the Principle of Fast Arrival to indicate a minimum opening hand. Since you have nothing extra you pass quietly.}

{It is your bid. 

Although you could show your singleton \C now it is usually more informative to show a second 5-card suit. So you say 4\D. Partner bids 4\H. What do you say? 

Partner signed off, showing a minimum, so you have nothing further to say.}

{It is your bid. 

Opening hand with 4-card trump support. You bid 2NT. Partner rebids 3\D. What do you say? 

The news that partner has a singleton \D does NOT excite you. In fact it causes your hand to devalue a lot. So you use the Principle of Fast Arrival and bid 4\H.}
