{Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

Except for the \S weakness you have a nice hand. If partner can Help you in that suit then you want to be in game.

So you bid 2\S and partner bids 4\H. Sometimes it is easy.}

{Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

You do have 9 points so you are inclined to bid game, but partner needs help in \Ds, and you are bankrupt there. But rather than just signing off, this hand gives you a way to temporize.

You bid 3\H, a bid not covered in the Summary, but which you hope partner will interpret as meaning: "I can't help you in \Ds, but I have some great \Hs."

Apparently partner interpreted it the way you wanted since he bid the game.}
