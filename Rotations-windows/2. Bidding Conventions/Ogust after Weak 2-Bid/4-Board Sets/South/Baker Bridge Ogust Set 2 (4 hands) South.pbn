{You could just guess between pass, 3NT, or 5\D.

But you use Ogust instead. Partner responds 3\D. What do you bid next? 

Partner's 3\D bid shows a minimum hand but a good suit, which should mean two of the top three honors. Your \DK tells you that partner has a 6-card \D  suit headed by the A Q. With three outside Aces you can count 9 tricks - you bid 3NT.}

{This is a perfect hand for Ogust - when you're not sure what to do! So you bid 2NT. Partner responds 3NT. What do you bid next? 

Partner's 3NT bid describes his hand exactly; \H A K Q x x x and nothing else. You MIGHT have a \S stopper, but they might be arranged so the defenders could take the first 5 \S tricks. So you bid the "safe" 4\H game which depends only on a 3-2 trump split.}
