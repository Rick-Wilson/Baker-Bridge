{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

Your partner has shown a minimum opening hand, but with 6 \Ss. You are happy with the 8-card trump fit but need to know about Key-Cards. So you bid 4NT. Partner answers 5\S and it is your bid again. 

Partner has two Aces and the \SQ. That should be all he needs to make slam so you bid 6\S.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would say next, then  on BID above. 

Partner has 15-17 points and 4 \Ss. You have 18 points and 4 \Ss. You plan to bid the slam, but first you check Key-Cards. So you bid 4NT. Partner says 5\C. What do you bid? 

You are missing 1 Key-Card. Slam has become less certain. You decide to see if partner has the trump Queen so you bid 5\D. Partner bids 5\S. What do you say next? 

Partner denies having the \SQ. Knowing that the best you could hope for would be a finesse to make the slam you give up your quest and pass.}
