North doesn't have 4 \Hs, nor does she have 3 \Ss. She does, however, have stoppers in \Cs so she bids 2NT. South happily says 3NT.}

{East opens 1\S. West responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

East's priority is to now show the 4-card \H suit. Remember that West might also have 4 \Hs.

West doesn't have 4 \Hs, nor does she have 3 \Ss. Furthermore,  she does not have stoppers in \Cs so she cannot bid NT. Since she has to keep bidding, but has no reasonable bid she can make, she bids the fourth suit, 3\C. Compare this Deal with Deal 21.

East understands that West's \C bid is Fourth-Suit-Forcing, and does not actually show \Cs. However since East does have a \C stopper he bids 3NT. In this case this turns out to be the best game contract.}

{North passes and South opens 1\S. 

North now bids 2\D. Since North originally passed this is NOT 2/1 Game Force. Instead, it is forcing for one round and shows 11 or more points. 

South next shows her 4-card \H suit. North gives a preference to 2\S.

Knowing that North does not have opening strength South passes 2\S.}

[Result ""]
{West opens 1\S. With 9 points and a doubleton \S East must respond 1NT. 

In standard bidding West would happily pass a 1NT response. But in 2/1 the 1NT response is forcing for 1 round. West is forced to bid a 3-card minor so he says 2\C. 

East prefers \C over \S but must allow for the possibility that West has bid a 3-card suit. So East gives a preference to 2\S. This is called a "false preference", but it assures the team of being in at least a 7-card fit. 

West happily passes and the pair lands in a reasonable contract, probably better than 1NT. }
