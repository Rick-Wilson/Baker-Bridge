{North opens 1\S, his 5-card Major. South, with 14 points, responds 2\C, a 2/1 force to game.

North next bids 2\H, showing the other Major suit.

South assumes North to be 5-4 in the Majors, so she cannot support either. She cannot bid 2NT without a stopper in \Ds. So South bids the fourth suit, 3\D, telling North she knows she must make a bid, but can't find anything appropriate.

North now must find a bid. His choices include rebidding the 5-card \Ss, supporting South's \Cs with a doubleton Queen, or bidding 3NT with the \D K 6 as a stopper. He chooses this last option. It appears that 3NT is the best game for these two hands.}

[Result ""]
{North opens 1\S, her 5-card Major and South responds 2\H. North knows this is a 5-card suit, and bids 3\H, confirming the 8+card trump fit.

Once the trump fit is known, South revalues his hand to about 19 points. He makes a slam try with  a control-showing bid of 3\S. He knows North won't take this as \S support since the partnership has agreed that \Hs are going to be trumps.

North now shows her control by bidding 4\C.

That was what South needed to hear; when Blackwood uncovers two Aces he bids 6\H.

The slam is a good one. If either the \SQ or \CK is right there are 12 tricks by way of a finesse. But the best way to play the hand would be to try to establish a \S in the North hand, and if that fails try the \C finesse.}

[Result ""]
{North opens 1\H and South responds 2\C. Using standard bidding North would now jump to 3NT to show his 19 points, but in 2/1 this is not necessary since the partnership must not stop bidding until game is reached. So North just bids 2NT. South shows her minimum by bidding 3NT.

North will now disclose his extra strength. He bids 4NT. This is not Blackwood, but rather a quantitative raise in Notrump, and an invitation to slam.

South has 15 points, and they are good ones. She accepts the invitation and bids 6NT.

There are 11 top tricks. A 3-3 \H split would provide the 12th winner, but this is against the odds. Better to try two \S finesses, a 75% chance.}

[Result ""]
{South opens 1\S and North responds 2\D. South has a pretty good hand, 17 points, but no stopping power in the minor suits. Also, South's \S suit is pretty ragged. Taking these points into consideration, South should just rebid his 6-card suit.

North should now jump to 4\S. This is Fast Arrival, indicating a minimum hand with no particular interest in slam.

South is happy to rest in the game contract.

Even with a combined 30 points, T tricks are certainly not a sure thing. South must hope that East holds the trump King.}
