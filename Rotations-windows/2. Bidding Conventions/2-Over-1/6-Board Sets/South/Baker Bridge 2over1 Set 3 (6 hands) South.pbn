{North opens 1\S. South has a powerhouse, plenty strong enough to jump-shift. But playing 2/1 it's usually simpler when you make the 2/1 response, and save your jumping for later - if at all. So South bids just 2\H, knowing North must keep the bidding open.

North knows South has at least 5 \Hs, so his first priority is to agree on the trump suit. He bids 3\H.

South now makes the slam try. She knows North has at least three trumps, and all she wants to find out is how many Aces/Kings North holds. So she bids Blackwood and North confesses to two Aces.

Still hoping for the Grand, South bids 5NT. Oops, North doesn't have any kings so South settles for a small slam.

This is a good slam, cold if West makes any opening lead other than a \C. With a \C lead, South will have to pull trumps and play to discard a loser on the \ST.}

{South opens 1\H and North responds 2\D.

South has a good-looking hand, but needs to find a trump suit before she starts showing her extra strength, so she bids just 2\H.

Knowing that South holds 6 \Hs, North can support with the honor doubleton so he agrees the trump suit with a Fast Arrival bid of 4\H.

South has some extra strength, but not enough to push on after North's weak bid. Notice that if South DID try a 4\S Control bid North would just bid 5\H and the pair might be one trick too high.}

[Result ""]
{North opens 1\S. South has 11 points, enough to respond 2\H in standard bidding, but not when using 2/1. So she bids 1NT.

North would love to pass 1NT but is not permitted to do so. He has no good bid, so he must bid a 3-card suit. When holding two 3-card minors, usually bid \Cs. South now shows the \H suit that she could not bid first round.

North was forced to reply to 1NT, but he is not forced to bid again. With his minimum hand and a tolerance for partner's suit he just passes and the partnership ends up in a reasonable contract.

This hand demonstrates one of the benefits of Forcing 1NT. In standard bidding South's first response would be 2\H, and North would have to bid again, probably 2NT. The partnership might go even higher but in any case would probably not reach a good contract.}

{North opens 1\S. South has 11 points, enough to respond 2\C, (or 2\D), in standard bidding, but not when using 2/1. So she bids 1NT.

North is forced to bid again, but unlike the previous hand, here he wants to keep bidding. He bids 2\C. South knows North doesn't have \Hs, so she shows her above-minimum hand by bidding 2NT.

North is happy to play Notrump. He assumes South must have something useful in \Ds and bids 3NT.

3NT seems to be a good contract. There are 8 top tricks and possibilities for a ninth winner in either \Ss, \Ds, or, (the best chance), \Cs.}

{South opens 1\H. North responds 1NT, just as in standard bidding. The difference is that in this case the 1NT response is forcing on South.

South has an easy second bid, he rebids his 6-card suit. North has nothing to say over 2\H except pass.

Notice that this is the same bidding and same final contract that would have been reached with standard bidding. Using 2/1 is often like that.}

{South opens 1\S. North responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

South cannot rebid her \Ss, but has decent support for partner's \Ds. So she bids 3\D.

North always intended to play a \S contract. He now bids 4\S, using Fast Arrival to indicate he has no slam aspirations.

4\S is cold, and if the defenders don't take their \H tricks immediately South will make an overtrick.}
