{South opens 1\H and West Doubles.

After the intervening Takeout Double 2/1 is OFF. If North had T or more points she would Redouble. So even with only 9 points North can bid 2\C without fear that South will think she has a strong hand.

South also knows everything mentioned above so he passes.}

{East opens 1\S. West responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

East has a big hand, perhaps in the slam range, but first priority is to set a trump suit. So she contents herself with a rebid of 2\S.  West agrees on trumps by bidding 3\S (not Fast Arrival).

East now makes her slam try by using a Control-showing cue-bid. She bids 4\C, showing first round control of the suit (Ace or Void).

West's next bid would be a control-showing bid of her own - IF SHE HAD ONE. Since she cannot win the first round of either red suit she just returns to 4\S. East realizes that they are off two red Aces and passes.

Notice that East did not fall into the Blackwood trap. If she HAD asked for Aces, West would have shown one Ace and East wouldn't know what to do next. She might have figured the odds favored that one Ace being a red one and tried the slam. Moral: Don't use Blackwood when you have a void.}

South doesn't have 4 \Hs, nor does she have 3 \Ss. She does, however, have stoppers in \Cs so she bids 2NT. North happily says 3NT.}

{West opens 1\S. East responds 2\D, a 2/1 force to game. 

West's priority is to now show the 4-card \H suit. Remember that East might also have 4 \Hs.

East doesn't have 4 \Hs, nor does she have 3 \Ss. Furthermore,  she does not have stoppers in \Cs so she cannot bid NT. Since she has to keep bidding, but has no reasonable bid she can make, she bids the fourth suit, 3\C. Compare this Deal with Deal 21.

West understands that East's \C bid is Fourth-Suit-Forcing, and does not actually show \Cs. However since West does have a \C stopper he bids 3NT. In this case this turns out to be the best game contract.}

{East opens 1\S. With 9 points and a doubleton \S West must respond 1NT. 

In standard bidding East would happily pass a 1NT response. But in 2/1 the 1NT response is forcing for 1 round. East is forced to bid a 3-card minor so he says 2\C. 

West prefers \C over \S but must allow for the possibility that East has bid a 3-card suit. So West gives a preference to 2\S. This is called a "false preference", but it assures the team of being in at least a 7-card fit. 

East happily passes and the pair lands in a reasonable contract, probably better than 1NT. }
