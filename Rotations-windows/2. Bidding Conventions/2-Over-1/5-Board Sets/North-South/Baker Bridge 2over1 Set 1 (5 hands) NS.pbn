{After North's 1\H opening South counts 12 HCP plus one length point for the fifth \D. That is enough for a 2/1 response so South says 2\D.

The partnership is now forced to reach game so North bids 2NT. This describes a balanced hand with exactly 5 \Hs and no 4-card \S suit.

South is happy to play in Notrump, and with no extra strength above the 13 points already promised, uses Quick Arrival and bids 3NT. North passes and a reasonable game contract is reached.

Notice that you would bid this hand the same way whether or not you play 2/1.}

{South opens 1\H and North, with 16 points,  responds 2\D, forcing the partnership to game.

South has a minimum strength hand, but with a 6-card suit he rebids 2\H.

Opposite South's 6-card suit, North's doubleton is adequate support. If North had a minimum for her 2/1 response she might just jump to 4\H to show no interest in slam. With a little extra she bids 3\H since she knows the bidding cannot stop until game is reached. From North's perspective South might have a big hand; his 2-level rebid shows suit length but does not say anything about strength. This is one of the beauties of 2/1, the bidding can be kept low while you look for the best place to play. However, this time South merely bids the game and North passes.

The hand would have been bid the same with or without 2/1.}

[Result ""]
{With 16+ points and 3 \Hs, South will insist on a \H game at a minimum. But there is no need to start making jump bids, she starts with a simple 2\D bid. North also refrains from a jump, and rebids 2\H to show the 6-card suit.

South now says 3\H to set the trump suit. At this point North reveals some slam interest, making a control-showing bid of 4\C. South continues the process, and bids 4\D, showing the \DA.

North has heard enough. He bids 4NT, and when South admits to two Aces he bids the slam.}

[Result ""]
{South has a minimum 1\S opening bid. After West's 2\D overcall both South and North know that the 2/1 Game Force in no longer on. North can therefore bid 2\H, showing at least 11 points. This bid is forcing on South for 1 round, but not forcing to game.

South next rebids his \Ss, promising a 6-card suit, but also indicating a minimum strength hand! Since the Game Force is not on, South would have to make a jump bid to show extra strength.

North has nothing further to say so the partnership arrives in a safe contract.}

{North opens 1\S, the higher ranking of the two 5-card suits.

South, with 14 points, responds 2\C, forcing the partnership to game.

North now bids his \H suit.

At this point South figures North for 5 \Ss and 4 \Hs. South cannot support either of North's Majors, but with a good stopper in the fourth suit bids 2NT. The game force is still on and North may not pass this bid.

North bids 3\H, indicating that this is also a 5-card suit. Now South can bid the \H game, knowing there is an 8-card fit.}
