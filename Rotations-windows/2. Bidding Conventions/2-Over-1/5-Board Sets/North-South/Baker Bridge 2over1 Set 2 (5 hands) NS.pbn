{South opens 1\S and North, with 14 points, responds 2\H. Note that North is not permitted to make this bid without a 5-card or longer \H suit.

South, knowing that North has 5, bids 3\H to confirm the trump suit.

North has a minimum strength hand with no slam aspirations, so he uses Fast Arrival and bids 4\H. South is also satisfied to just play at game.

2/1 is a good bidding method, and here, 4\H is a good contract. But you can see that it is not a laydown - there is no bidding system that will always reach T0% contracts. In this hand a 3-3 \D split will provide the Tth trick, or if that fails, taking 2 \S finesses provides a 75% chance of success.}

{South has 13 points and naturally opens 1\S.

North, with 15 points, would bid 2\H in standard bidding, but with 2/1 this promises a 5-card suit. So instead, North responds 2\C, forcing the partnership to game. Note that holding two 4-card minors North bids them up-the-line, just as in standard bidding.

South has a nice 6-card \S suit, so you might think he would rebid them. But Opener's first responsibility with his second bid is to show a 4-card Major if he has one. This isn't much of a suit, but South still bids 2\H.

You can see why it is important for Opener to show a 4-card Major. Since North couldn't bid \Hs in her first response the fit would have been lost if South had not mentioned the suit. North now confirms the trump suit with a 3\H bid, and South shows his minimum by just bidding the game.}

{South opens 1\H, his 5-card Major. North, with 14 points, naturally responds 2\D, forcing the partnership to game.

South next bids 2\S, showing the other Major suit. In standard bidding South would not be able to bid the \Ss since that would be a Reverse and South is far too weak to Reverse. But after a 2/1 Response the concept of a Reverse does not apply, and the priority of showing a 4-card Major certainly does apply.

North assumes South to be 4-5 in the Majors, so she cannot support either. She bids 2NT. If South actually has 6 \Hs (or 5 \Ss) he will rebid the suit. North's 2NT bid guarantees a stopper in the fourth suit.

South does not have either 6 \Hs or 5 \Ss so he just bids 3NT. Notice that South never once considered the possibility of passing what might be a misfit - the initial 2/1 response unconditionally forced the partnership to reach a game somewhere.}

{South opens 1\S, his 5-card Major. North, with 14 points, responds 2\C, a 2/1 force to game.

South next bids 2\H, showing the other Major suit.

North assumes South to be 5-4 in the Majors, so she cannot support either. She cannot bid 2NT without a stopper in \Ds. So North bids the fourth suit, 3\D, telling South she knows she must make a bid, but can't find anything appropriate.

South now must find a bid. His choices include rebidding the 5-card \Ss, supporting North's \Cs with a doubleton Queen, or bidding 3NT with the \D K 6 as a stopper. He chooses this last option. It appears that 3NT is the best game for these two hands.}

{South opens 1\S, her 5-card Major and North responds 2\H. South knows this is a 5-card suit, and bids 3\H, confirming the 8+card trump fit.

Once the trump fit is known, North revalues his hand to about 19 points. He makes a slam try with  a control-showing bid of 3\S. He knows South won't take this as \S support since the partnership has agreed that \Hs are going to be trumps.

South now shows her control by bidding 4\C.

That was what North needed to hear; when Blackwood uncovers two Aces he bids 6\H.

The slam is a good one. If either the \SQ or \CK is right there are 12 tricks by way of a finesse. But the best way to play the hand would be to try to establish a \S in the South hand, and if that fails try the \C finesse.}
