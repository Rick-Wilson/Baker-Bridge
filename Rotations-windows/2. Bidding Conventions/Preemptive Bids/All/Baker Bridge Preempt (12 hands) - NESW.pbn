{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have 13 points and if partner had opened with a 1\S bid you'd be feeling "jumpy". But what a preemptive bidder needs from dummy are immediate winners, not points. So you pass.

Here's a pretty good tip:When partner opens with a 3-bid and you are trying to decide whether to take him to game, visualize him holding this very hand:K Q J T x x x of trumps and nothing in any other suit. Then base your decision on that.}

No matter how much we try to reduce bridge to rules and guidelines we will never get rid of the judgement factor. With this hand you definitely have 3 fast tricks for partner. In theory he can take 6 of his own, so 3\H should be the right contract. BUT, maybe he could ruff a \D in your dummy?

Fortune favors the bold so you bid 4\H . . . and live happily ever after.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 7 estimated winners and an 8-card suit you preempt 4\S. And you are not going to make it. In fact you are only going to make 8 tricks so you will go down 2.

You may be wishing that you had opened just 3\S, rather than following the guidelines and opening at the 4-level. The problem with that thinking is that the lower your preempt, the less difficult it is for the opponent's to enter the bidding. If you had opened 3\S East might have been able to make a Takeout Double and they could have found their \H fit. Just visualize their combined hands; they have 9 \Hs between them, they have no \S losers, no \C losers and just one \D loser. If they decide to finesse your partner for the \HQ they can make slam.

This is what preempting is all about.}

If is hard to imagine any hand partner could have where the slam wouldn't be there. Maybe you should use Blackwood, just to be sure? If partner shows 1 Ace you would then bid 6\S. And if he shows no Aces you would then . . . bid 6\S anyway. So you leave out the middle step and bid 6\S.

Did you think about bidding 6NT instead? Ugh, they would have led a \C.}

You do not have the 4 fast winners you need to raise partner to the 4-level. But you do have 4 of his trumps and 2 and a half winners. And your side doesn't have much defense against a 3\S contract. You should raise partner to 4\D because you think they can make 3\S. With these hands it appears they might have gone to 4\S in which case you would have had to decide whether to continue to 5\D. More judgement would be called for,based on Vulnerability, whether you think they can make the game, etc. The Law of Total Tricks can be a help in these competitive situations; it would lead you to 5\D.}
