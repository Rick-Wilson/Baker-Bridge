{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

You have 13 points and if partner had opened with a 1\S bid you'd be feeling "jumpy". But what a preemptive bidder needs from dummy are immediate winners, not points. So you pass.

Here's a pretty good tip:When partner opens with a 3-bid and you are trying to decide whether to take him to game, visualize him holding this very hand:K Q J T x x x of trumps and nothing in any other suit. Then base your decision on that.}

{The bidding has been as shown. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

No matter how much we try to reduce bridge to rules and guidelines we will never get rid of the judgement factor. With this hand you definitely have 3 fast tricks for partner. In theory he can take 6 of his own, so 3\H should be the right contract. BUT, maybe he could ruff a \D in your dummy?

Fortune favors the bold so you bid 4\H . . . and live happily ever after.}

{You dealt this hand. Decide what you would bid, then  on BID above. 

With 7 estimated winners and an 8-card suit you preempt 4\S. And you are not going to make it. In fact you are only going to make 8 tricks so you will go down 2.

You may be wishing that you had opened just 3\S, rather than following the guidelines and opening at the 4-level. The problem with that thinking is that the lower your preempt, the less difficult it is for the opponent's to enter the bidding. If you had opened 3\S West might have been able to make a Takeout Double and they could have found their \H fit. Just visualize their combined hands; they have 9 \Hs between them, they have no \S losers, no \C losers and just one \D loser. If they decide to finesse your partner for the \HQ they can make slam.

This is what preempting is all about.}
