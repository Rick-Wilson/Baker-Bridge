{With a 5-card â™  suit and 13 points NORTH should overcall 1â™ .

SOUTH has 13 points and four â™ s. If NORTH had opened, SOUTH's hand would be good enough

to insist on game. But since NORTH overcalled, SOUTH merely invites with a jump to 3â™ .

NORTH has better than a minimum overcall so she accepts the invitation and bids 4â™ .}

SOUTH has 13 points and only wants to play in one contract, 4

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has 18 points, a doubleton in the opponent's suit, and at least three cards in the unbid suits.

This is an ideal hand for a Takeout Double.

NORTH has good strength in EAST's

â™¦

suit, probably two stoppers.

He has 9 points and no 4-card suit of his own. This is the type of hand to respond 1NT.

SOUTH is happy to play Notrump now that she knows the

â™¦

s are covered,

so she bids 3NT.}

{NORTH has an opening hand, 14 points and five â™ s. But WEST beat him to the punch,

SOUTH also has 14 points, she doesn't care too much for â™ s, but she has an

excellent stopper in

She jumps to 2NT, inviting NORTH to bid game.

{NORTH has 15 points and all the requirements for a Takeout Double of 1â™ .

With 14 points of his own, SOUTH knows his side needs to be in a game somewhere. He passes this information

to NORTH with a cue-bid of 2â™ .

NORTH gets the message and starts the hunt for a trump fit by bidding 3

â™¥

makes it easy for SOUTH - he bids 4
