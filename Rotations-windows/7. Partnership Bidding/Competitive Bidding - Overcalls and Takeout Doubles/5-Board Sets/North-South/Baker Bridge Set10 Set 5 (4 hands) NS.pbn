{WEST obviously has to pass when SOUTH opens 1â™ .

EAST has a reasonable Takeout Double. She hopes WEST will name a suit and they can just

play a partscore.

You should almost always bid when partner makes a Takeout Double. Almost always. This is the one time

when you don't. WEST's â™  are so good that he passes, converting the Takeout Double into a

Penalty Double.}

{NORTH has a normal overcall of 1â™ .

SOUTH has a really good hand, but he doesn't have to worry about missing a slam since NORTH will

not have more than 16 points. So he just bids what he thinks NORTH can make, 4â™ .}
