{There is only one reason that SOUTH should not overcall with 1â™ . He is too strong.

The maximum strength of an overcall is 16 points. Above that you should double.

So SOUTH doubles, and after NORTH bids 2â™£, SOUTH bids 2â™ . This shows an overcall

type hand, but with 17 or more points.

NORTH has fine trump support and 8 points so she bids a confident 4â™ .}

{WEST would have had a great opening 1â™  bid. But when SOUTH opened 1â™ 

in front of him he was hornswaggled. He couldn't bid any other suit, he couldn't bid 1NT

and he sure couldn't bid â™ s. So he must pass.

And so does everybody else pass.}

{If East had passed, SOUTH would have opened with a preemptive 3â™ .

She should make the same bid with the same hand AFTER the opponents open. And she makes it

for the same reason, to describe her hand and to take away bidding space from the opponents.

NORTH treats it just like a Preemptive 3-bid, even though it is now called a Weak Jump Overcall.

In this case, NORTH passes.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has 12 points, but with two 5-card suits worthy of an overcall. There isn't really a

right and wrong here, but it usually works out best to overcall in the higher-ranking suit. That

leaves open the possibility of bidding the second suit later.

In this Deal, after SOUTH overcalls 1â™ , that later possibility never happens because

everybody should pass.}
