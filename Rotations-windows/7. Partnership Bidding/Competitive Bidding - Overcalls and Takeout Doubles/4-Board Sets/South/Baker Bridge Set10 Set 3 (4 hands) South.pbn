{SOUTH has 20 points, excellent

stoppers and a balanced hand.

She is two points too strong to overcall 1NT. Instead, she doubles.

NORTH has an awful hand - but since he is forced to bid he says 1â™ , assuming SOUTH wants

to hear his best suit.

SOUTH now bids 1NT, showing the balanced 19-21 point hand. NORTH passes, of course.}

{SOUTH has a 19 point balanced hand, including a stop in

He plans to double, then bid NT. (see Deal 9)

NORTH has 10 points though, so he jumps to 2â™ .

In theory SOUTH could now bid 2NT to continue the description of his hand, but he might as well

go ahead and bid 3NT instead.}

{With a 5-card â™  suit and 13 points SOUTH should overcall 1â™ .

NORTH has 13 points and four â™ s. If SOUTH had opened, NORTH's hand would be good enough

to insist on game. But since SOUTH overcalled, NORTH merely invites with a jump to 3â™ .

SOUTH has better than a minimum overcall so she accepts the invitation and bids 4â™ .}
