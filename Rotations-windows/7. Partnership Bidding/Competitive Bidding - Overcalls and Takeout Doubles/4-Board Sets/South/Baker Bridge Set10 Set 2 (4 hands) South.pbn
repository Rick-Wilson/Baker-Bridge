{NORTH has 14 points, a doubleton in the opponent's â™  suit and at least three cards in

each of the other suits. This is a normal Takeout Double.

SOUTH has a really awful hand. He has just one point and his only 4-card suit is the one the

opponents have already bid. He wants nothing more than to pass.

But he cannot pass. Partner's Double said "Bid your best suit.", so he bids 2â™£.

Mercifully NORTH also passes.}

{With 14 points, â™£ shortage, and support for the other suits NORTH makes a Takeout Double.

SOUTH has 13 points so she bids 2â™£. This is an artificial bid, apprising NORTH of SOUTH's opening

hand strength, and forcing the partnership to reach the game level.

NORTH sugggests

â™¥

s as trumps.

SOUTH doesn't like

â™¥

s so she suggests â™ s.

NORTH agrees with â™ s and bids game, 4â™ .}

{WEST's 1

â™¥

opening is passed around to SOUTH. He is

tempted to overcall 1â™ , but with 18 points is a little strong for a mere overcall.

Instead, he doubles.

With 8 points NORTH is not strong enough to jump. She bids 2â™£.

SOUTH now bids 2â™ . By doubling first, then bidding his own suit,

he shows a good suit and 17+ points.

NORTH raises to 4â™ .}

{SOUTH has 18 points, a balanced hand, and a good stopper in their suit. He should overcall 1NT.

For 1NT overcalls, the range is increased to 15-18 points.

NORTH bids 2â™£ (Stayman), just as she would with a 1NT opening. When SOUTH denies holding

a 4-card Major NORTH has enough points to bid 3NT. She doesn't worry about a â™  stopper

since SOUTH promised he had the suit controlled.}
