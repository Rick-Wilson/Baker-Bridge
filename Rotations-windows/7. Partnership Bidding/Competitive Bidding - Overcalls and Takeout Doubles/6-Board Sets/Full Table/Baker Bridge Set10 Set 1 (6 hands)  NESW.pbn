{NORTH has an opening hand, 15 points, and a 5-card â™  suit. Unfortunately WEST beat her to

the punch by opening 1

â™¥

.

But NORTH should get into the bidding anyway, by Overcalling 1â™ . This shows a good â™  suit

and somewhere between 9 and 16 points.

SOUTH has 6 points. If NORTH had actually OPENED 1â™ , SOUTH would be obligated to bid. But knowing that

the Overcall will not be made with more than 16 points, SOUTH just passes.}

{EAST has an opening hand, 15 points and five â™ s. But NORTH beat him to the punch,

so he overcalls 1â™ .

WEST has 11 points, and if EAST had opened she would make a Limit Raise to 3â™ .

But when replying to an Overcall, the strength needs to be a little higher. In Deal 1 it was OK to

pass a 1â™  Overcall with 6 points, here it is correct to just raise to 2â™  with 11 points.

EAST actually has a strong Overcall so he bids 4â™ .}

{This time SOUTH has just 10 points, nowhere near an opening hand. Still, when EAST opens

1

â™¥

SOUTH should Overcall 1â™ . This shows a good â™  suit

and somewhere between 9 and 16 points.

NORTH has 13 points. If SOUTH had actually OPENED 1â™ , NORTH would insist on game. But SOUTH didn't

Open, she just Overcalled. So NORTH must be more cautious. He jumps to 3â™  and SOUTH shows her

minimum type hand by passing.}

{EAST has 15 points, a singleton in the opponent's suit and 4-card support for any suit

partner might name. In other words, a perfect Takeout Double.

WEST needs to make a medium-strong bid to apprise EAST of her 10 points. She jumps to 2â™ .

EAST's hand is now worth 17 points because of the singleton. Since he is quite happy with

â™ s he bids 4â™ .}

{SOUTH has 14 points, a doubleton in the opponent's â™  suit and at least three cards in

each of the other suits. This is a normal Takeout Double.

NORTH has a really awful hand. He has just one point and his only 4-card suit is the one the

opponents have already bid. He wants nothing more than to pass.

But he cannot pass. Partner's Double said "Bid your best suit.", so he bids 2â™£.

Mercifully SOUTH also passes.}

EAST has 13 points so she bids 2â™£. This is an artificial bid, apprising WEST of EAST's opening

hand strength, and forcing the partnership to reach the game level.

WEST sugggests

â™¥

s as trumps.

EAST doesn't like

â™¥

s so she suggests â™ s.

WEST agrees with â™ s and bids game, 4â™ .}
