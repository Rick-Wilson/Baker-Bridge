{NORTH has 18 points, a doubleton in the opponent's suit, and at least three cards in the unbid suits.

This is an ideal hand for a Takeout Double.

SOUTH has good strength in WEST's

â™¦

suit, probably two stoppers.

He has 9 points and no 4-card suit of his own. This is the type of hand to respond 1NT.

NORTH is happy to play Notrump now that she knows the

â™¦

s are covered,

so she bids 3NT.}

{NORTH has an opening hand, 14 points and five â™ s. But WEST beat him to the punch,

so he overcalls 1â™ .

SOUTH also has 14 points, she doesn't care too much for â™ s, but she has an

excellent stopper in

â™¥

s.

She jumps to 2NT, inviting NORTH to bid game.

Since NORTH has several points more than he might have had, and no 6-card â™  suit to rebid,

he happily bids 3NT.}

{SOUTH has 15 points and all the requirements for a Takeout Double of 1â™ .

With 14 points of his own, NORTH knows his side needs to be in a game somewhere. He passes this information

to SOUTH with a cue-bid of 2â™ .

SOUTH gets the message and starts the hunt for a trump fit by bidding 3

â™¥

. That

makes it easy for NORTH - he bids 4

â™¥

.}

[Result ""]
{There is only one reason that SOUTH should not overcall with 1â™ . He is too strong.

The maximum strength of an overcall is 16 points. Above that you should double.

So SOUTH doubles, and after NORTH bids 2â™£, SOUTH bids 2â™ . This shows an overcall

type hand, but with 17 or more points.

NORTH has fine trump support and 8 points so she bids a confident 4â™ .}
