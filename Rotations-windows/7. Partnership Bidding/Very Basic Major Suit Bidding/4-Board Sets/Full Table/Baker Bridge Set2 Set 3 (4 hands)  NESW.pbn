{SOUTH has 11 points and she should pass.

SOUTH, with 4-card trump support, jumps to 3

â™¥

.

(This is called a Limit Raise.)

A Limit Raise is an invitational bid, but NORTH can add and he knows the total points will

be either 24 or 25. So he passes 3

EAST passes, knowing he is not missing a game contract. WEST can have a maximum of 10 points, which would

only reach 24 points when added to his 14.}

{With a 5-card â™  suit and 16 points SOUTH should open 1â™ .

NORTH has 11 points and four â™ s. So even though he has a balanced hand,

he jumps to 3â™ , a Limit Raise.

SOUTH adds: her 16 plus NORTH's 11/12 equals a game, 4â™ .}

{WEST has the type of 5-card Major hand that many players would open 1NT.

He has 17 points with most of them OUTSIDE the Major suit. But, many others

would disagree so for this Deal WEST will open 1â™ .

EAST has 11 points and excellent (is that strong enough?) â™  support.

So she naturally makes a Limit Raise of 3â™ .

WEST adds the points and ignores the fact that his â™  suit is Jack high.

He bids 4â™ .}
