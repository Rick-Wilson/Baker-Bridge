{NORTH has 18 points and a 5-card

suit. This is a good hand

to open 1

SOUTH has three

s which is adequate support. But SOUTH only

has 4 points which is not strong enough to respond. So SOUTH passes.}

{EAST has 17 points counting 1 extra for the fifth â™ . This is a middle-range hand with five â™ s.

So he opens 1â™ .

WEST only has 7 points, 6 in high cards and one more for the doubleton

â™¦

.

But she does have three â™ s, so she can respond 2â™ .

Since EAST is middle-range, he makes one more try by bidding 3â™ .

If WEST had 9 or 10 points she would now bid 4â™  - but with 7 she passes.}

{With 8 points, NORTH is not strong enough to open the bidding.

SOUTH has 13 points, barely meeting the minimum for a 1-opening. Note that the fifth and

sixth â™  each added 1 point to his count. He opens 1â™ .

Although NORTH passed originally, she must respond to SOUTH's opening bid. Since she has

three â™ s she raises to 2â™ .

In light of NORTH's weak response SOUTH passes.}

WEST's hand is worth one more try. He invites with 3

EAST had a strong 2
