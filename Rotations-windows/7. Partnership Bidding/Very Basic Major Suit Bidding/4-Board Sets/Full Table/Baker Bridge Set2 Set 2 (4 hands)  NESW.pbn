{SOUTH has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1â™ .

NORTH has good â™  support and 10 points, counting 1 for the doubleton â™£.

It is easily worth a raise to 2â™ 

SOUTH cannot bid game yet, after all, NORTH could have as few as 6 points. But she can

continue with a 3â™  bid in hopes that NORTH actually has 9 or 10 points.

NORTH comes through with 4â™ .}

{WEST has a bare minimum 13 point hand, and he should open 1

EAST has 11 points and good

WEST knows he has been invited to bid higher, but with nothing above minimum he must pass.}
