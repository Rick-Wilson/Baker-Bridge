NORTH also has opening hand strength, 14 points for him. He also has four of SOUTH's

bids 4

IMPORTANT NOTE: Most experienced bridge pairs would not bid the hand quite this way, although they

would arrive at the same contract. See some of the other BakerBridge lessons for more details.}

{SOUTH has a powerful hand (21 points) with a good 6-card suit. He opens 1â™ .

SOUTH now knows that the partnership holds at least 32 points, perhaps 33. Since he can see that

the opponents have no way to win the first two tricks he decides to bid the slam, 6â™ }

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has 14 points and opens 1â™ , her 5-card Major.

NORTH could bid 3â™ , a Limit Raise with his 11 points. But it is often a good idea,

when you have five of the Major suit that partner opened with, to just go ahead and bid

the game. So North should bid 4â™  here.

See the NOTE in Deal 13. When you use weaker 5-card support hands for your jump to game, you

need to find another way to describe your opening-hand-strength type hands.}
