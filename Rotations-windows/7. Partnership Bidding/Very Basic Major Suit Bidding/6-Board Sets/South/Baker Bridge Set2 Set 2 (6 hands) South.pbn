{SOUTH has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1â™ .

NORTH has good â™  support and 10 points, counting 1 for the doubleton â™£.

It is easily worth a raise to 2â™ 

SOUTH cannot bid game yet, after all, NORTH could have as few as 6 points. But she can

continue with a 3â™  bid in hopes that NORTH actually has 9 or 10 points.

NORTH comes through with 4â™ .}

NORTH, with 4-card trump support, jumps to 3

A Limit Raise is an invitational bid, but SOUTH can add and he knows the total points will

{SOUTH has the type of 5-card Major hand that many players would open 1NT.

He has 17 points with most of them OUTSIDE the Major suit. But, many others

would disagree so for this Deal SOUTH will open 1â™ .

NORTH has 11 points and excellent (is that strong enough?) â™  support.

So she naturally makes a Limit Raise of 3â™ .

SOUTH adds the points and ignores the fact that his â™  suit is Jack high.

He bids 4â™ .}
