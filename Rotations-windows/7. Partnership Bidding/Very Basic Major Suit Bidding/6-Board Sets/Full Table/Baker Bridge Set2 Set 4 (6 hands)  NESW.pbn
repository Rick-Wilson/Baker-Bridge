{NORTH has 20 points, counting two extra for the fifth and sixth â™ s.

Naturally she opens 1â™ .

SOUTH has a poor hand, but with 7 points he must respond. He has four of partner's â™ s

so he responds 2â™ .

NORTH

KNOWS

that 6 + 20 = 26, so she

GOES

to 4â™ .}

{WEST has 14 points so he opens one of his 5-card Major suit, 1â™ .

EAST has some good â™£s, but with four of partner's Major she doesn't bother bidding anything else.

Since she has 11 points she jumps to 3â™ , a Limit Raise.

WEST is very close to passing. He now gets to add a point for his doubleton â™£ which takes

him up to 15 points. So he has enough to bid 4â™ .}
