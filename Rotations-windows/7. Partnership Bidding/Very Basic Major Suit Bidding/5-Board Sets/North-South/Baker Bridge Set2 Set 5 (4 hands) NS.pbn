{SOUTH has 14 points so he opens one of his 5-card Major suit, 1â™ .

NORTH has some good â™£s, but with four of partner's Major she doesn't bother bidding anything else.

Since she has 11 points she jumps to 3â™ , a Limit Raise.

SOUTH is very close to passing. He now gets to add a point for his doubleton â™£ which takes

him up to 15 points. So he has enough to bid 4â™ .}
