{EAST has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1â™ .

WEST has good â™  support and 10 points, counting 1 for the doubleton â™£.

It is easily worth a raise to 2â™ 

EAST cannot bid game yet, after all, WEST could have as few as 6 points. But she can

continue with a 3â™  bid in hopes that WEST actually has 9 or 10 points.

WEST comes through with 4â™ .}

EAST, with 4-card trump support, jumps to 3

(This is called a Limit Raise.)

A Limit Raise is an invitational bid, but WEST can add and he knows the total points will

be either 24 or 25. So he passes 3
