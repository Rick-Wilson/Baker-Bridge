{This is the companion to Deal 6. The cards are the same except that the

â™¦

s and â™£s have been swapped.

Again, SOUTH has no problem as long as NORTH holds at least one Key-card.

When NORTH responds 5â™£, (showing one Key-card), SOUTH can pass.

That's what happens here.}

{WEST needs to know how many Aces EAST holds.

One way to find out would be to bid 3â™ , (which is forcing), then launch Blackwood.

Another way is to bid 4â™£ (Gerber) right now.

The first way is probably better but we needed a Gerber example.}

NORTH figures a small slam would be safe, but just to be sure she uses Blackwood.

reply shows one Key-card which must be the trump King,

and a

NORTH readjusts her thinking and decides to bid the Grand.}

{When SOUTH agrees to â™ s, NORTH will not stop short of a slam.

The RKCB 4NT bid tells NORTH that they have all five Key Cards since SOUTH could hardly

have a 2â™£ opening hand with no Aces.

NORTH's 5

â™¥

bid is the Queen Ask, and SOUTH's reply confirms that she holds

the â™ Q, and also has the â™£K.

NORTH figures the â™  suit will run, and this should be enough for Grand Slam. He chooses 7NT.}

[Result ""]
{EAST knows there are enough points for slam, but she is worried about the trump suit.

WEST's support doesn't guarantee more than three â™ s, and if they are not headed

by the Queen she could lose a trump trick.

Her RKCB bid relieves her mind when EAST claims two Key Cards PLUS the â™ Q.

She bids 6â™  (and hopes for a 3-2 trump split!).}
