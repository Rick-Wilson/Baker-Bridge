{When NORTH makes a slam try with a jump to 3â™ , the best approach for SOUTH is to agree on

the trump suit immediately but indicate a minimum hand by bidding 4â™ .

NORTH's next move is logical; RKCB 4NT.

SOUTH shows zero or three Key Cards, and since it could not possibly be zero, NORTH knows they are

the â™ K and both red Aces. Even possessing all the Key Cards NORTH knows there aren't

enough points for a Grand slam.}

{It is usually not recommended to use any form of Blackwood when you have a suit with two quick

losers, but EAST knows WEST would not preempt with a 10-high

â™¥

suit.

WEST's reply to RKCB is 5

â™¥

, showing two Key Cards.

EAST knows they are the

â™¥

A

â™¥

K

so she can count thirteen tricks.

She bids a confident 7NT (and hopes WEST didn't open 3

â™¥

with a 6-card suit.}

{SOUTH has 21 points, and when she hears NORTH make a limit raise she tries for slam with RKCB.

NORTH answers with just one Key Card so SOUTH stops at 5â™ , knowing they are missing

two Key Cards.

Of course she didn't expect the two missing Key Cards to be the Ace and King of trumps!}

{What is this doing here in the RKCB Practice Pages?

To emphasize that there are many 4NT bids which are NOT asking for Aces.

In this case, WEST showed a balanced hand with 18 or 19 points, and EAST invited him

to bid 6NT if he felt his hand was a "maximum". He didn't, so he passed.}
