{NORTH realizes SOUTH has fewer than 8 points, but the 3â™  support bid is enough

for her to try a RKCB 4NT bid.

SOUTH shows two Key Cards and NORTH figures they will be the â™ K and one of the

red Aces. So she bids 6â™ . If instead the Key Cards are the two red Aces NORTH

might possibly make all thirteen tricks with a finesse.}

{WEST's 3

â™¥

bid is "encouraging" so EAST bids 4NT.

When WEST shows one Key Card, (an Ace), EAST is afraid he may have a trump loser as well the

other Ace. To find out about the

â™¥

Q he

bids 5

â™¦

, the Queen Ask.

WEST has the

â™¥

Q but no King so she jumps

to 6

â™¥

.}

{This is the companion to Deal 22.

Again, worried about a possible trump loser in addition to the missing Ace, SOUTH

bids 5

â™¦

, the Queen Ask.

NORTH definitely does NOT have the

â™¥

Q. But with five trumps she

does know that SOUTH probably does not have a trump loser so she jumps

to 6

â™¥

anyway.}

{EAST cannot use RKCB at her second bid because trumps have not been agreed. So she bids

3

â™¥

to set trumps, knowing WEST cannot pass after her jump-shift.

WEST tries to stop at game but EAST is too strong so she now uses RKCB and gets

to 6

when WEST shows two Key Cards and the trump Queen.}
