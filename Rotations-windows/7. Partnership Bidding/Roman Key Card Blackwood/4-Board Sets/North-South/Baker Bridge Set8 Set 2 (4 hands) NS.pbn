{NORTH has interest in slam after she hears SOUTH's Limit Raise.

BUT, she should not use Blackwood holding two quick losers in the

â™¦

suit.

Instead she makes a Control showing bid of 4â™£. (Not Gerber since it didn't follow a NT bid.)

SOUTH cooperates by making a Control bid of 4

â™¥

.

NORTH stops at 4â™  because neither partner controls

â™¦

s.}

{NORTH decides it is unlikely that SOUTH is Aceless, so all he wants to know is the number of Aces SOUTH does have.

He invokes RKC Blackwood.

Since no trump suit has been agreed, SOUTH bids as if

â™¦

s, the

last-bid suit prior to 4NT is agreed. SOUTH has two Key-cards plus the trump Queen, so she bids 5â™ .

NORTH bids 6

â™¦

.

If SOUTH had just one Key-card, NORTH would bid 5

â™¦

over the 5â™£ reply.}

{This is the companion to Deal 6. The cards are the same except that the

â™¦

s and â™£s have been swapped.

Again, SOUTH has no problem as long as NORTH holds at least one Key-card.

When NORTH responds 5â™£, (showing one Key-card), SOUTH can pass.

That's what happens here.}

[Result ""]
{NORTH needs to know how many Aces SOUTH holds.

One way to find out would be to bid 3â™ , (which is forcing), then launch Blackwood.

Another way is to bid 4â™£ (Gerber) right now.

The first way is probably better but we needed a Gerber example.}
