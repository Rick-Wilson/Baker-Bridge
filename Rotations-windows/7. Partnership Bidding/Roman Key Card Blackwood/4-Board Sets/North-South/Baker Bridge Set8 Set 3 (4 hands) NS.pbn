SOUTH figures a small slam would be safe, but just to be sure she uses Blackwood.

SOUTH readjusts her thinking and decides to bid the Grand.}

{When SOUTH agrees to â™ s, NORTH will not stop short of a slam.

The RKCB 4NT bid tells NORTH that they have all five Key Cards since SOUTH could hardly

have a 2â™£ opening hand with no Aces.

NORTH's 5

â™¥

bid is the Queen Ask, and SOUTH's reply confirms that she holds

the â™ Q, and also has the â™£K.

NORTH figures the â™  suit will run, and this should be enough for Grand Slam. He chooses 7NT.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH knows there are enough points for slam, but she is worried about the trump suit.

NORTH's support doesn't guarantee more than three â™ s, and if they are not headed

by the Queen she could lose a trump trick.

Her RKCB bid relieves her mind when SOUTH claims two Key Cards PLUS the â™ Q.

She bids 6â™  (and hopes for a 3-2 trump split!).}
