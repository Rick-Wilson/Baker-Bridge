{What is this doing here in the RKCB Practice Pages?

To emphasize that there are many 4NT bids which are NOT asking for Aces.

In this case, SOUTH showed a balanced hand with 18 or 19 points, and NORTH invited him

to bid 6NT if he felt his hand was a "maximum". He didn't, so he passed.}

{When NORTH makes a Splinter bid, showing

SOUTH naturally thinks about slam.

She uses RKCB 4NT, and NORTH, with one Key Card and a â™£ Void, bids 6â™£.

Just what SOUTH needed for the 6

{NORTH thinks they should be in slam, and uses Stayman to check for a 4-4 Major fit.

When SOUTH announces four â™ s NORTH uses RKCB 4NT.

SOUTH's 5â™  bid shows two Key Cards plus the â™ Q.

This fills the holes in NORTH's hand nicely, so she bids 6â™ .}

{This is the companion hand to Deal 18.

Again, NORTH uses RKCB after the 4-4 â™  fit is discovered.

This time SOUTH shows two Key Cards without the â™ Q.

Now NORTH realizes that in addition to one outside Ace, there is a very possible loser

in trumps. So she stops at 5â™ .}

[Result ""]
{The chances of a slam on this hand are very small, and if SOUTH decides to use RKCB it will

just confuse matters when NORTH shows two Key Cards.

SOUTH has a better way to find out about the hand. She bids 2NT asking NORTH to further describe

his hand. NORTH should then bid 3NT, showing a solid suit headed by AKQ.

NORTH cannot have as much as an extra Jack, so SOUTH just passes 3NT.}
