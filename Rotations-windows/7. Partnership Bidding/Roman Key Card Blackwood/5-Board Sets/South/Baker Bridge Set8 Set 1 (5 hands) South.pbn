{NORTH has a decent Limit Raise, and SOUTH tries RKC Blackwood.

NORTH replies to the 4NT bid with 5

â™¦

, zero or three Keycards.

So which is it, zero or three?

Pretty simple - since SOUTH holds three Keycards himself NORTH can hardly have three also since there

are only five total. She must have zero and SOUTH signs off at 5

{NORTH jumps to 4â™ , confident that SOUTH could make 10 tricks

even if he just has 6 points.

SOUTH knows he can make more and bids RKCB 4NT.

NORTH's 5

â™¦

response shows zero or three Keycards.

So which is it? Zero or three?

NORTH bid much too strongly to have no Aces. SOUTH

bids a confident 6â™ , knowing NORTH has either three Aces or two Aces plus the â™ K.}

{SOUTH has interest in slam after she hears NORTH's Limit Raise.

BUT, she should not use Blackwood holding two quick losers in the

suit.

Instead she makes a Control showing bid of 4â™£. (Not Gerber since it didn't follow a NT bid.)

NORTH cooperates by making a Control bid of 4
