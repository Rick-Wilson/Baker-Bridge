{SOUTH decides it is unlikely that NORTH is Aceless, so all he wants to know is the number of Aces NORTH does have.

He invokes RKC Blackwood.

Since no trump suit has been agreed, NORTH bids as if

â™¦

s, the

last-bid suit prior to 4NT is agreed. NORTH has two Key-cards plus the trump Queen, so she bids 5â™ .

SOUTH bids 6

â™¦

.

If NORTH had just one Key-card, SOUTH would bid 5

â™¦

over the 5â™£ reply.}

{This is the companion to Deal 6. The cards are the same except that the

â™¦

s and â™£s have been swapped.

Again, NORTH has no problem as long as SOUTH holds at least one Key-card.

When SOUTH responds 5â™£, (showing one Key-card), NORTH can pass.

That's what happens here.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH needs to know how many Aces NORTH holds.

One way to find out would be to bid 3â™ , (which is forcing), then launch Blackwood.

Another way is to bid 4â™£ (Gerber) right now.

The first way is probably better but we needed a Gerber example.}

{SOUTH's positive response shows 8+ points and five or more cards headed by at least two honors.

NORTH figures a small slam would be safe, but just to be sure she uses Blackwood.

SOUTH's 6

reply shows one Key-card which must be the trump King,

and a

NORTH readjusts her thinking and decides to bid the Grand.}
