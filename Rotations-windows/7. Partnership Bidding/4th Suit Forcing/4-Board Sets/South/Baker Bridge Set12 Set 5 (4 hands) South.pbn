{SOUTH could make a Help Suit Game Try in either â™ s or â™£s.

But she doesn't need the â™  help as much as she does in â™£s, so she chooses â™£s.

NORTH doesn't have a strong hand but has excellent help in â™£s

so he bids the game.}

{Could SOUTH bid 2

Perhaps, but there is no reason to do so. NORTH does not have four

â™¥

s

or he would have mentioned them before bidding â™ s.

SOUTH should ignore the

â™¥

suit and bid 3NT.}

{SOUTH cannot bid 2

Fourth Suit Forcing and wouldn't show the

â™¥

suit at all.

With a game-forcing two-suiter he jumps to 3

â™¥

instead.

NORTH recognizes that SOUTH must hold five â™ s and bids the â™  game.}

{NORTH bids 2â™£ as New Minor Forcing, hoping SOUTH has three

s.

SOUTH does not have three

â™¥

s and he has no other bid to make that

will describe his hand any better. He cannot bid Notrump again without a â™£ stopper.

So SOUTH rebids the 5-card

â™¦

suit.

NORTH has nowhere to go, so passes.}
