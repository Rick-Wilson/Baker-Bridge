{SOUTH is unlikely to win 10 tricks if NORTH has three â™£ losers.

SOUTH's 3â™£ bid is a Help Suit Game try.

With no help in â™£s and no ruffing values, NORTH's 8 points are

not enough to think of game, so NORTH signs off in 3

â™¥

{NORTH cannot rebid the 5-card â™  suit, cannot support SOUTH's

â™¦

s,

and cannot bid Notrump without a

â™¥

stopper.

So she bids 3â™£, New Minor Forcing, asking SOUTH to describe his hand further.

SOUTH doesn't have three â™ s, nor does he have four

â™¥

s.

But he does have

â™¥

s stopped, so bids 2NT. North is not strong

enough to bid game so she passes.}
