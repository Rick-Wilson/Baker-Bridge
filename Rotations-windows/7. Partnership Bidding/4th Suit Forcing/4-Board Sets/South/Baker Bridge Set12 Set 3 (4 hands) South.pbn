bid is a Help Suit Game Try.

NORTH barely had enough strength to respond in the first place, but revaluing the hand,

(and particularly the singleton

â™¥

), makes it worth a

raise to game.}

{NORTH knows there should be game, but doesn't know whether it will be 4â™ ,

4

â™¥

or 3NT. To find out which she uses NMF and

bids 2â™£ at her second turn.

SOUTH does not have a 4-card

â™¥

suit, nor does he have

three â™ s, but he does have â™£s stopped so he bids 2NT, which North raises to 3NT.}
