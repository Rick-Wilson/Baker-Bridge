{NORTH has a perfect hand on which to use Fourth Suit Forcing. If South can stop

â™ s, then 3NT would be a great contract.

There is one problem - if NORTH bids 1â™  at her second turn it is NOT considered

FSF, so she must jump to 2â™ .

SOUTH, win a fine â™  stopper, bids 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH's 2

â™¦

bid is a perfect example of NMF.

It provides NORTH with the opportunity to show either a 4-card

â™¥

suit,

OR 3-card â™  support.

In this hand NORTH actually has both. When that happens, showing the

â™¥

s is

first priority.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH's 1â™  bid is definitely forcing, but it is not FSF. In this one instance, all

bids at the one level, the â™  bid shows a real suit.

So NORTH shows the 4-card support and SOUTH bids game.}
