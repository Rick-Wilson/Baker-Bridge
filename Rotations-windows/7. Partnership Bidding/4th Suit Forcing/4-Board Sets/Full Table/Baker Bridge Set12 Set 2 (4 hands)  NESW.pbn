he does not have four â™ s or he would not have bid 1NT.

So WEST should bid the Notrump game.}

But it doesn't hurt to bid 2

(Fourth Suit Forcing) just to

see if NORTH happens to have three â™ s. She does, so 4â™  becomes the better game.}

EAST uses the 2

(NMF) bid to ask WEST for further description.

WEST should first show a 4-card
