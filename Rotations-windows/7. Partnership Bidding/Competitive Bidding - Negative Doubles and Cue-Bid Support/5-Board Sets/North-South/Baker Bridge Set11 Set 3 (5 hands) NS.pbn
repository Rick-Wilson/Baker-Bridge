{Compare this to Deal 10.

SOUTH has the strength for a raise to game in â™ s, but this could be dangerous since NORTH

has overcalled rather than opened. Instead, SOUTH shows her strength with a Support Cue-bid.

NORTH has very minimal overcall so he just bids 2â™  which SOUTH passes.}

{SOUTH has both Majors and planned on bidding 1

first, (up-the-line).

After EAST's overcall, SOUTH makes a Negative Double, showing both Majors and at least 10 points to

make a 2-level Negative Double.

NORTH bids 2

â™¥

, showing a 4-card suit and minimum opening hand. Notice

that this is not a Reverse by NORTH, showing extra strength. She is not really bidding

â™¥

s on her own, she is supporting partner's suit.

SOUTH has 13 points so he bids 4
