{Compare this with Deal 8.

SOUTH has 7 points, barely enough for a 2

â™¥

raise if there had been no overcall.

But when EAST puts in the â™  bid, SOUTH can jump to 3

â™¥

as a preemptive

measure. He knows NORTH won't think he has strength because he did not make a Support Cue-bid.

NORTH does know it and passes 3

{WEST has the strength for a raise to game in â™ s, but this could be dangerous since EAST

has overcalled rather than opened. Instead, WEST shows her strength with a Support Cue-bid.

EAST in fact had a pretty good overcall so he jumps to 3â™  and WEST bids the game.

With a weak overcall EAST would have just returned to 2â™  which WEST would pass.}
