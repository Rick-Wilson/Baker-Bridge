{NORTH has a minimum 2â™£ opening.

SOUTH, with 8 points and a 5-card suit, should make a positive response, 2â™ .

NORTH shows the â™  support first, to set the trump suit, and to give SOUTH an opportunity

for a move toward slam if he wants to do so.

SOUTH would now make a Control-showing bid IF HE HAD A CONTROL. Since he doesn't he just returns

to 4â™  which NORTH passes.}

{SOUTH opens 2â™£ and NORTH responds 2

showing fewer than 8 points.

SOUTH bids 2NT with a 23 point balanced hand.

NORTH has enough points to bid 3NT, but with two 4-card Major suits bids 3â™£ Stayman instead. SOUTH

won't confuse this as the second negative since that bid isn't used after a 2NT rebid.

So SOUTH shows her 4-card

â™¥

suit and NORTH bids 4

â™¥
