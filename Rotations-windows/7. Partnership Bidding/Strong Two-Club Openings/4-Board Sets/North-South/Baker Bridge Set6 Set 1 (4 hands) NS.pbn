{NORTH has a perfect hand for an opening bid of 2â™£.

23 points and balanced distribution is just fine.

SOUTH is glad to hear his partner has lots of points, because he was shortchanged.

However, he must answer, so with 1 point he bids a negative 2

â™¦

.

NORTH describes her hand by saying 2NT.

SOUTH does not have to bid the double negative over a 2NT bid, so he passes.}
