{After NORTH's 2â™£ opening, SOUTH bids 2NT, showing a balanced hand of at least 8 points. SOUTH

actually has 12 points, but the time to show the extra strength will be later.

NORTH's 3â™£ bid is Stayman, asking SOUTH for a 4-card Major. SOUTH mentions his â™ s and

NORTH bids 4â™ , showing a minimum 2â™£ opener with 4 â™ s.

Now SOUTH adds his 12 points to NORTH's 22 minimum and gets 34. He bids 6â™ .}
