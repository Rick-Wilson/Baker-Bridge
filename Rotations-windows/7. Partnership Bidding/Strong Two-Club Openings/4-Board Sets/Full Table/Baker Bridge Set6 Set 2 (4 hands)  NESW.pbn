{NORTH has lots of points - 26 to be exact. She opens 2â™£.

In the old days this hand would have been opened 3NT.

SOUTH has 4 points and responds 2

.

NORTH now shows her full strength by jumping to 3NT (25-27 points, balanced).

SOUTH knows there is no slam, so he passes 3NT.}

With 8 points, SOUTH can make a positive response so he bids his 5-card

suit.

NORTH likes

s, knows there are at least 33 points, but needs to make

sure the opponents don't have two Aces so she uses Blackwood.
