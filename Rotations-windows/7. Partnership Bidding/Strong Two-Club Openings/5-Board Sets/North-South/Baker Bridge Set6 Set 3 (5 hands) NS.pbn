{NORTH opens 2â™£ and SOUTH responds 2

showing fewer than 8 points.

NORTH bids 2NT with a 23 point balanced hand.

SOUTH has enough points to bid 3NT, but with two 4-card Major suits bids 3â™£ Stayman instead. NORTH

won't confuse this as the second negative since that bid isn't used after a 2NT rebid.

So NORTH shows her 4-card

â™¥

suit and SOUTH bids 4
