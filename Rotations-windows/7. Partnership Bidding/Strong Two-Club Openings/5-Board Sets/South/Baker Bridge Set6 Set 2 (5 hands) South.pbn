NORTH likes

{NORTH has a minimum 2â™£ opening.

SOUTH, with 8 points and a 5-card suit, should make a positive response, 2â™ .

NORTH shows the â™  support first, to set the trump suit, and to give SOUTH an opportunity

for a move toward slam if he wants to do so.

SOUTH would now make a Control-showing bid IF HE HAD A CONTROL. Since he doesn't he just returns

to 4â™  which NORTH passes.}
