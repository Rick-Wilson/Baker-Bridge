{NORTH's 3

rebid shows better than average strength and six trumps.

Just what SOUTH was hoping for. She bids Blackwood - her plan is to bid 7

â™¥

if NORTH has three Aces, bid 6

â™¥

if he has two Aces,

and stop at 5

â™¥

if he has just one. If North has no Aces SOUTH will get a new partner.}

{EAST indicates an above normal opening with five â™ s by her 3NT rebid.

WEST also has some extra strength so he makes a Control showing bid of 4

â™¥

.

Despite both partners showing extra strength East merely signs of at 4â™ . Why? Because WEST's

Control bid of 4

â™¥

denied first-round control in both â™£s and

â™¦

s. EAST realized she was off two Aces.}

{SOUTH has a minimum opening hand with no extra features to brag about.

So after NORTH's Jacoby 2NT bid he merely signs off at 4â™ .

NORTH would have cooperated if SOUTH had made a slam try, but she doesn't have enough

to initiate the investigation herself.}

{EAST's 4â™£ is a Splinter bid.

He promises 13+ points, at least four

â™¥

s and a singleton or void in â™£s.

WEST is obviously forced to game, but she is not thrilled to hear about EAST's â™£ shortness. In fact,

it does nothing to help the value of her hand. So she bids the

â™¥

game.}

She doesn't have any controls.
