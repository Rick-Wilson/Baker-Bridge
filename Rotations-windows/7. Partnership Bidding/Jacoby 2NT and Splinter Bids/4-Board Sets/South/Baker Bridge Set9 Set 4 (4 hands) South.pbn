{NORTH's 3â™  bid, a double-jump, is a Splinter bid. It shows game-forcing strength, at

least four cards in partner's suit, and a singleton or void in the Splintered suit.

SOUTH has just 14 points and the â™  shortness in NORTH's hand doesn't improve her hand since

she had just one â™  loser anyway. She signs off in 4

â™¥

{This is a companion hand to Deal 13.

SOUTH has 14 points, the same strength she had in Deal 13. But what a difference.

This time NORTH's â™  shortness complements her hand very well. She bids 4â™£

to show her Control, and after NORTH shows the

â™¦

A she

uses Blackwood to make sure NORTH also has the trump Ace.}

{NORTH has 13 points and good 3-card support for SOUTH's 1

â™¥

opening bid.

But he should not bid 2NT since that bid promises 4+ cards in support. North must still insure

they reach game, so he bids a forcing 2â™£.

When SOUTH next says 2NT NORTH can jump to 4

â™¥

.

NOTE: if you used Jacoby 2NT and reached the 4

â™¥

game, give yourself credit anyway.}
