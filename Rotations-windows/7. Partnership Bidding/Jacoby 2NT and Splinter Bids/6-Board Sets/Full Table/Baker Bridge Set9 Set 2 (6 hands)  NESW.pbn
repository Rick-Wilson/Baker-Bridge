{NORTH indicates an above normal opening with five â™ s by her 3NT rebid.

SOUTH also has some extra strength so he makes a Control showing bid of 4

â™¥

.

Despite both partners showing extra strength North merely signs of at 4â™ . Why? Because SOUTH's

Control bid of 4

â™¥

denied first-round control in both â™£s and

â™¦

s. NORTH realized she was off two Aces.}

So after WEST's Jacoby 2NT bid he merely signs off at 4â™ .

WEST would have cooperated if EAST had made a slam try, but she doesn't have enough

to initiate the investigation herself.}

{NORTH's 4â™£ is a Splinter bid.

He promises 13+ points, at least four

â™¥

s and a singleton or void in â™£s.

SOUTH is obviously forced to game, but she is not thrilled to hear about NORTH's â™£ shortness. In fact,

it does nothing to help the value of her hand. So she bids the

â™¥

game.}
