{NORTH might just use Jacoby 2NT since he has great

â™¥

support and

more than 13 points. But, he has so much more than 13 points that he should inform partner by

making a jump-shift. He plans to return to

â™¥

s later.

SOUTH has different plans. Knowing partner has five â™ s and 17 or more points she pushes

straight to the â™  slam.

It didn't matter, slam is cold in either Major.}
