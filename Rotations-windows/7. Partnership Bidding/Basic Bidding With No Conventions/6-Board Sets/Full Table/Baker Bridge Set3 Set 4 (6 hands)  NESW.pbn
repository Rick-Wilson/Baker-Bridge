{SOUTH has 19 points, but no 5-card Major suit. With two 4-card minor suits she should start

NORTH has a poor hand, but with 7 points he must respond. His first priority is to show a Major suit

so he responds 1â™ .

SOUTH now knows that â™ s will be trumps, so she revalues her hand to 21 points, enough for game.

She bids 4â™ .}

{NOTE: There is a better way to bid this hand using special conventions.

EAST has 17 points, but with a 5-card Major opens 1â™  rather than 1NT.

WEST isn't quite strong enough for a jump raise, so she bids 2â™ .

EAST has enough extra to make a try for game, so she invites with 3â™ .

WEST has enough extra to accept the invitation, bids 4â™ .}

{SOUTH has a perfect 2NT opening hand, 20 points and 3-3-3-4 distribution.

NORTH, with 12 points of his own, knows the partnership is borderline strong enough for slam.

Since he is happy with Notrump, he invites SOUTH to bid slam by responding 4NT.

With one more point SOUTH might bid the slam, but here she just passes.}

{WEST opens 1NT with 15 points and a balanced hand.

EAST, with 9 points, cannot bid game herself, but she can invite WEST to bid game if he

has the maximum 17 point opener. So she responds 2NT.

WEST doesn't have maximum, he has minimum, so he passes.}
