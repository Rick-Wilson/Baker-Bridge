{SOUTH has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1â™ .

NORTH has excellent â™  support but with 11 points is not quite strong enough to insist

on reaching game. Instead he makes an invitational jump to 3â™ , which SOUTH is strong

enough to raise to game.}

{NORTH has a powerful hand, but 21 points is not strong enough to start with a forcing 2â™£ bid.

Since he has balanced distribution he opens 2NT (20-21 points).

SOUTH adds her 6 points to NORTH's minimum and concludes they should be in game. She expects her

good

â™¦

suit to be useful to SOUTH in Notrump so she bids 3NT.}

SOUTH must respond with 8 points, but cannot bid either minor suit since he needs at least

11 points to bid a new suit at the 2-level. So he bids 1NT (6-10 points).

NORTH doesn't object to Notrump so she passes.}
