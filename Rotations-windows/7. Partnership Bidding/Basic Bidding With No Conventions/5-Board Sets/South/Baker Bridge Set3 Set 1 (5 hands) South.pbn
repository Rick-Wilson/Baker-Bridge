With 12 points, NORTH knows the partnership total is between 27 and 29, enough for game

but not enough to think about slam. Since NORTH has no 4-card Major suit she bids 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{With 6 points, SOUTH must respond to NORTH's 1â™£ opening bid.

While it is often correct to respond by bidding suits "up-the-line", SOUTH should

skip over the weak

â™¦

suit in favor of showing the 4-card

Major â™  suit.

NORTH knows that SOUTH may only have four â™ s, but with four of her own she can support the

suit. Since she has a minimum opening bid she merely raises to 2â™ .

With his minimum response hand SOUTH passes.}
