{With balanced distribution and 16 points NORTH should open 1NT rather than 1

â™¦

.

SOUTH's response is based on simple math. He adds his 18 points to the 15 minimum that NORTH has announced and

comes up with 33 points combined. This is enough for a small slam, and since he has balanced distribution

he bids 6NT.}

EAST does not have 3-card â™  support but with 7 points must make some response.

She cannot bid at the 2-level so she says 1NT (6-10 points).

WEST is fine with Notrump so he bids 3NT.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has a minimum 1â™  opening bid - 13 points and five trumps. She doesn't even suspect

what's about to befall!

NORTH hears the 1â™  bid and all he wants to know is whether SOUTH has one, two or three Aces.

So he uses the Blackwood convention, 4NT.

SOUTH has two Aces so she bids 5

â™¥

(5â™£ would show zero Aces,

5

â™¦

would show one Ace, etc).

NORTH has heard enough and bids 6â™ .}

{WEST has an above-minimum strength hand with a good 6-card suit. He opens 1

EAST, with 9 points, is a little too weak to bid at the 2-level so she bids a catchall 1NT.

WEST shows his 6-card suit and extra strength by jumping to 3

â™¥

, which

EAST raises to 4

â™¥

since two trumps is now adequate support.}
