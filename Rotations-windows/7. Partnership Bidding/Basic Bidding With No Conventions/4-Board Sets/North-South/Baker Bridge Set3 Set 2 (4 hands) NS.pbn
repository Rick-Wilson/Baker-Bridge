{This is a classic Notrump bidding sequence.

NORTH opens 1NT with 17 points and balanced distribution.

SOUTH, with 9 points is not strong enough to bid game, but invites with 2NT.

NORTH has a maximum, so she accepts the invitation.}

{NORTH has 17 points and might open 1NT. But with the 5-card Major suit she prefers

to open 1â™ .

SOUTH has excellent â™  support but with 11 points is not quite strong enough to insist

on reaching game. Instead he makes an invitational jump to 3â™ , which NORTH is strong

enough to raise to game.}

{SOUTH has a powerful hand, but 21 points is not strong enough to start with a forcing 2â™£ bid.

Since he has balanced distribution he opens 2NT (20-21 points).

NORTH adds her 6 points to SOUTH's minimum and concludes they should be in game. She expects her

good

â™¦

suit to be useful to NORTH in Notrump so she bids 3NT.}
