SOUTH doesn't object to Notrump so she passes.}

{With balanced distribution and 16 points NORTH should open 1NT rather than 1

â™¦

.

SOUTH's response is based on simple math. He adds his 18 points to the 15 minimum that NORTH has announced and

comes up with 33 points combined. This is enough for a small slam, and since he has balanced distribution

he bids 6NT.}
