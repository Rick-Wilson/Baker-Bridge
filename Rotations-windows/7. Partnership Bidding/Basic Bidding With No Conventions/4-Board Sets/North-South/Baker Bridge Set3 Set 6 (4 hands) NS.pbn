{NORTH has a perfect 2NT opening hand, 20 points and 3-3-3-4 distribution.

SOUTH, with 12 points of his own, knows the partnership is borderline strong enough for slam.

Since he is happy with Notrump, he invites NORTH to bid slam by responding 4NT.

With one more point NORTH might bid the slam, but here she just passes.}

{SOUTH opens 1NT with 15 points and a balanced hand.

NORTH, with 9 points, cannot bid game herself, but she can invite SOUTH to bid game if he

has the maximum 17 point opener. So she responds 2NT.

SOUTH doesn't have maximum, he has minimum, so he passes.}
