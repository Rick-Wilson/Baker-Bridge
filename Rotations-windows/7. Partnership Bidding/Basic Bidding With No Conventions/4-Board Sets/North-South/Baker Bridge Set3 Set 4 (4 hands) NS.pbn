{NORTH has a minimum 1â™  opening bid - 13 points and five trumps. She doesn't even suspect

what's about to befall!

SOUTH hears the 1â™  bid and all he wants to know is whether NORTH has one, two or three Aces.

So he uses the Blackwood convention, 4NT.

NORTH has two Aces so she bids 5

â™¥

(5â™£ would show zero Aces,

5

â™¦

would show one Ace, etc).

SOUTH has heard enough and bids 6â™ .}

{SOUTH has an above-minimum strength hand with a good 6-card suit. He opens 1

â™¥

.

NORTH, with 9 points, is a little too weak to bid at the 2-level so she bids a catchall 1NT.

SOUTH shows his 6-card suit and extra strength by jumping to 3

â™¥

, which

NORTH raises to 4

â™¥

since two trumps is now adequate support.}

{NORTH has 14 points and opens her 4-card â™£ suit.

SOUTH must respond, and with two 4-card Majors bids them "up-the-line", saying 1

NORTH now shows his 4-card â™  suit, and SOUTH again must bid. Since SOUTH is pretty weak he just

raises to 2â™ , which NORTH happily passes.}

[Result ""]
{SOUTH has a maximum 17 point 1NT bid.

NORTH, with 16 points, can't tell if there are enough points for slam. If SOUTH has

17 points then a slam should be makeable, but if SOUTH has only 15 points then he

should settle for game.

The 4NT raise solves the problem. It tells SOUTH to bid 6NT with 17 points, pass

with 15 points, and use best judgment with 16. Here SOUTH bids the slam.}
