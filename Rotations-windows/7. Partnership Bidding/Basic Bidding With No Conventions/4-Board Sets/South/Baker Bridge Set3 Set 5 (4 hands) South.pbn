{NORTH has just 11 points, not enough to open the bidding.

But when SOUTH opens 1â™  NORTH should show her "almost opening strength"

by jumping to 3â™ .

SOUTH has just 13 points, and knowing NORTH has less than 13 he passes.}

{After SOUTH opens with 1

â™¥

, NORTH has a small "dilemma".

With 11 points she really is only strong enough to make a jump raise to 3

â™¥

.

But, with five trumps the hand deserves more. So she just bids 4

â™¥

instead.

Usually, no matter what your strength, when you have five cards in the Major suit that your partner opens

with you should just jump right to game.}

{NORTH has 19 points, but no 5-card Major suit. With two 4-card minor suits she should start

with 1

â™¦

.

SOUTH has a poor hand, but with 7 points he must respond. His first priority is to show a Major suit

so he responds 1â™ .

NORTH now knows that â™ s will be trumps, so she revalues her hand to 21 points, enough for game.

She bids 4â™ .}

{NOTE: There is a better way to bid this hand using special conventions.

SOUTH has 17 points, but with a 5-card Major opens 1â™  rather than 1NT.

NORTH isn't quite strong enough for a jump raise, so she bids 2â™ .

SOUTH has enough extra to make a try for game, so she invites with 3â™ .

NORTH has enough extra to accept the invitation, bids 4â™ .}
