{SOUTH is too weak to open 1

but just right for 2

.

Wow! NORTH has 21 HCP and two good

â™¥

s. Could this be time for a slam try?

Nope, no slam here. Suppose SOUTH has six

â™¥

s headed by the AK. The trump suit

would certainly be solid, but then SOUTH couldn't possibly have an outside Ace as well or he would have been

too strong for a Weak-two opening. So NORTH just bids 4

But there's no sense bidding and probably making matters worse, so she grits her
