{SOUTH is unsure whether to bid game or not, so he bids 2NT to get more information about

NORTH's hand.

NORTH's 3♠ is discouraging, a hand below average in strength and no outside high card.

SOUTH passes and hopes for the best.}

{SOUTH has no way to tell whether NORTH can provide one winner or not.

So she takes the bold approach and bids 4

♥

.

If the opening lead is a ♠ or a

♦

then SOUTH

will probably make the game. Otherwise she will likely go down one.}

{Most good players have an extra restriction in their Weak Two-bid guidelines - they won't

open with a Weak Two-bid when they hold an outside 4-card Major, even if the hand qualifies

otherwise. This Deal shows why.

If SOUTH opened with 2♠, NORTH might well pass and a

♥

game

would be missed.}
