{NORTH doesn't have much of a 3â™£ opening bid.

But SOUTH has just the type of hand you need to bid 3NT after partner's preempt. The other three

suits well stopped, and certain entry in Opener's long suit. Notice here that 3NT is a good contract,

but 5â™£ would go down 1.}

{NORTH has one of those hands which might or might not be helpful to SOUTH. He needs

NORTH was hoping for a high card in

s rather than â™£s, so

he signs off in 3â™ }

{With four fast winners SOUTH should think about game. The best approach is usually to

use 2NT to find out more about NORTH's hand.

SOUTH found out that NORTH has good opening strength, and, most importantly, either the

â™¥

A or

â™¥

K. Now that she doesn't

have to worry about the opponents taking the first five

â™¥

tricks

she bids 3NT.}

{SOUTH is strong enough to be thinking about game, depending on how good NORTH's hand is.

So he bids 2NT to get more information.

NORTH has the exact hand to say 3NT - a suit headed by AKQ.

Game (and bidding) doesn't get much easier.}
