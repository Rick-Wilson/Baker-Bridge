{SOUTH has a perfect hand for an opening bid of 2â™ .

NORTH will be tempted to respond with his opening hand and good trump support, but he should

resist the temptation. To raise a Weak Two-bid to game you should have quick winners, not just points.}

{Once more, SOUTH has the same hand as Deals 1 and 2.

This time NORTH has a very poor hand without any chance of making game. However, he should bid

4â™  anyway.

It is very likely that the opponents can make 4

â™¥

if East gets the

opportunity to get into the bidding. Hopefully the 4â™  bid will shut him out, and 4â™  probably

won't go down more than a couple of tricks.}

{SOUTH has a pretty normal preemptive 3

bid.

NORTH has the equivalent of an opening 1NT bid and will be very tempted to bid 3NT.

That might turn out to be a disaster, particularly if NORTH is unable to reach the SOUTH hand.

NORTH should assume SOUTH can win six tricks if

â™¦

s are trumps. Thinking this way points NORTH to her

best call - PASS.}
