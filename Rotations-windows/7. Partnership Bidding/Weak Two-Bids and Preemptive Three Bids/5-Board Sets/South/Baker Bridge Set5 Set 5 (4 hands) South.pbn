{NORTH is unsure whether to bid game or not, so he bids 2NT to get more information about

SOUTH's hand.

SOUTH's 3â™  is discouraging, a hand below average in strength and no outside high card.

NORTH passes and hopes for the best.}

{SOUTH has no way to tell whether NORTH can provide one winner or not.

So she takes the bold approach and bids 4

â™¥

.

If the opening lead is a â™  or a

â™¦

then SOUTH

will probably make the game. Otherwise she will likely go down one.}

{Most good players have an extra restriction in their Weak Two-bid guidelines - they won't

open with a Weak Two-bid when they hold an outside 4-card Major, even if the hand qualifies

otherwise. This Deal shows why.

If NORTH opened with 2â™ , SOUTH might well pass and a

â™¥

game

would be missed.}
