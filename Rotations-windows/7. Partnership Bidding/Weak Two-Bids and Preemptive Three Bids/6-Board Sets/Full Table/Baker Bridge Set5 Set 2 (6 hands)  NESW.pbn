{NORTH is too weak to open 1

Wow! SOUTH has 21 HCP and two good

â™¥

s. Could this be time for a slam try?

Nope, no slam here. Suppose NORTH has six

â™¥

s headed by the AK. The trump suit

would certainly be solid, but then NORTH couldn't possibly have an outside Ace as well or he would have been

too strong for a Weak-two opening. So SOUTH just bids 4
