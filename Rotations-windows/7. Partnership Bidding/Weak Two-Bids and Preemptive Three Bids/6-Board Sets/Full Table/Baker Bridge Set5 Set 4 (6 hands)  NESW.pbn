{The 2NT response to a Weak Two opening is a wonderful tool. You can learn a lot about

partner's hand and you are absolutely certain that it will not be passed out.

In this Deal NORTH has a huge hand and SOUTH opens 2

â™¦

.

There are a lot of approaches NORTH might try, but the simplest is to start with 2NT.

When SOUTH shows

â™¦

A K Q x x x NORTH has an easy 6NT bid.}

{WEST has no way to tell whether EAST can provide one winner or not.

If the opening lead is a â™  or a

will probably make the game. Otherwise she will likely go down one.}

{Most good players have an extra restriction in their Weak Two-bid guidelines - they won't

open with a Weak Two-bid when they hold an outside 4-card Major, even if the hand qualifies

otherwise. This Deal shows why.

If SOUTH opened with 2â™ , NORTH might well pass and a

â™¥

game

would be missed.}
