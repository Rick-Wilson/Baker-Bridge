{NORTH has one of those hands which might or might not be helpful to SOUTH. He needs

more information about SOUTH's hand, so he bids 2NT.

SOUTH has a better than average hand, so she bids 3â™£ to show a high card in the suit.

NORTH was hoping for a high card in

s rather than â™£s, so

he signs off in 3â™ }

{With four fast winners SOUTH should think about game. The best approach is usually to

use 2NT to find out more about NORTH's hand.

SOUTH found out that NORTH has good opening strength, and, most importantly, either the

â™¥

A or

â™¥

K. Now that she doesn't

have to worry about the opponents taking the first five

â™¥

tricks

she bids 3NT.}

{SOUTH is strong enough to be thinking about game, depending on how good NORTH's hand is.

So he bids 2NT to get more information.

NORTH has the exact hand to say 3NT - a suit headed by AKQ.

Game (and bidding) doesn't get much easier.}

NORTH always knew there would be a game bid, so with an 8-card fit he bids 4â™ }

{NORTH may have an opening hand, but it is just the wrong kind of hand to respond to

partner's preemptive bid. She doesn't have the immediate winners that SOUTH is likely

to need, but she is in good shape for defense should the opponents bid.

In other words, NORTH has the perfect hand with which to pass.}
