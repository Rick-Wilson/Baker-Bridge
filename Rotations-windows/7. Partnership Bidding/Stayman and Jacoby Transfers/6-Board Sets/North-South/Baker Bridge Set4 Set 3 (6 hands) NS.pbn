s), he starts his

responses with Stayman.

SOUTH denies holding any 4-card Major suit so NORTH gives up on

â™¥

s.

He next bids â™ s, showing five of them. He jumps to 3â™ , giving SOUTH the choice

between 4â™  or 3NT.

With three trumps SOUTH chooses 4â™ .}

{NORTH has a poor 9 points, but does have two 4-card Majors. So he uses Stayman.

When SOUTH bids â™ s, NORTH isn't strong enough to bid game herself, so she temporizes

with a 3â™  invitation.

SOUTH has a full 17 points so he accepts the invitation.}

{SOUTH, with 9 points and a 6-card suit, knows they should play in â™ s.

The question is: how high?

SOUTH transfers NORTH to â™ s, then invites by raising to 3â™ .

NORTH has only two trumps, (good ones, admittedly), but she has a maximum 17 point hand.

So she bids the â™  game.}

an 8-card Major suit fit. With the fit her hand now revalues to 11 points so she bids 4â™ .}
