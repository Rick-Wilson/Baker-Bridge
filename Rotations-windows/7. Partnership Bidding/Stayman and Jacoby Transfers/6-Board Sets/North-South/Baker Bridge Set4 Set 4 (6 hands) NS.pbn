{Even with a 6-card â™  suit NORTH uses Stayman because he also has a 4-card

â™¥

suit. Given a choice, playing a 4-4 Major fit is usually

preferable to a 6-2 or even a 6-3 fit.

But here SOUTH doesn't have four

â™¥

s so NORTH just bids

the game where he knows the partnership holds eight trumps.}

{SOUTH breaks the expected Transfer sequence by jumping to 3

instead

of bidding just 2

. This is called the "Super Accept" and it shows

a hand with four of the trump suit with maximum point count.

NORTH's â™£ bid and SOUTH's

bid are Control bids, showing first

round control of the suit that was bid.}

NORTH's 2

NORTH absolutely knows that SOUTH holds a 4-card Major -

{NORTH has a rotten hand, and many players would just pass 1NT.

But NORTH figures that having SOUTH play any 4-4 fit would be better than 1NT so

he bids 2â™£, Stayman. This is called "Garbage Stayman", and you can see why.

SOUTH bids 2

â™¥

either 2â™  or 2

â™¦

also.}

{Just having a 4-card Major doesn't mean you must automatically use Stayman.

Here SOUTH has a 4-card â™  suit, but decides not to seek a 4-4 fit because his

hand wouldn't have any ruffing values in a â™  contract. He bids 3NT.

Notice that even though NORTH also has four â™ s the 4-4 fit is not useful to them in

a â™  contract because neither hand can ruff any losers.}
