{SOUTH uses Stayman because he has a 4-card â™  suit.

NORTH's 2

response wasn't exactly what SOUTH was hoping for,

so SOUTH decides to bid 3NT.

NORTH absolutely knows that SOUTH holds a 4-card Major -

So NORTH bids 4â™ .}

{NORTH has a rotten hand, and many players would just pass 1NT.

But NORTH figures that having SOUTH play any 4-4 fit would be better than 1NT so

he bids 2â™£, Stayman. This is called "Garbage Stayman", and you can see why.

SOUTH bids 2

â™¥

and NORTH passes. He would have passed

either 2â™  or 2

â™¦

also.}

{Just having a 4-card Major doesn't mean you must automatically use Stayman.

Here SOUTH has a 4-card â™  suit, but decides not to seek a 4-4 fit because his

hand wouldn't have any ruffing values in a â™  contract. He bids 3NT.

Notice that even though NORTH also has four â™ s the 4-4 fit is not useful to them in

a â™  contract because neither hand can ruff any losers.}

{NORTH has an invitational (9 point) hand with five â™ s.

She bids it in the standard way - first transfer SOUTH to â™ s, then invite

SOUTH, with 17 points and three â™ s, accepts the game invitation and chooses 4â™ .}
