{NORTH, with 11 points and six â™ s, knows immediately that the final contract will be 4â™ 

since the partners must have at least eight â™ s and at least 26 points.

She concludes that it might be better for SOUTH to be the Declarer so she bids 2

â™¥

as a Jacoby Transfer. When SOUTH makes the required 2â™  bid she just bids 4â™  which

closes the auction with SOUTH as Declarer.}
