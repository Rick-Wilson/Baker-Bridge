{After NORTH opens 2NT, SOUTH is pretty sure there will be a slam in

â™¥

s.

But, the contract should be played from the NORTH side so the opening lead doesn't go through any vulnerable

â™  holding NORTH might have.

SOUTH transfers NORTH to

â™¥

s, then uses Blackwood to be sure they aren't

off two Aces. Missing one Ace he settles for 6

{Because NORTH holds a 4-card Major suit, (

â™¥

s), he starts his

responses with Stayman.

SOUTH denies holding any 4-card Major suit so NORTH gives up on

â™¥

s.

He next bids â™ s, showing five of them. He jumps to 3â™ , giving SOUTH the choice

between 4â™  or 3NT.

With three trumps SOUTH chooses 4â™ .}

[Result ""]
{NORTH has a poor 9 points, but does have two 4-card Majors. So he uses Stayman.

When SOUTH bids â™ s, NORTH isn't strong enough to bid game herself, so she temporizes

with a 3â™  invitation.

SOUTH has a full 17 points so he accepts the invitation.}

{SOUTH, with 9 points and a 6-card suit, knows they should play in â™ s.

The question is: how high?

SOUTH transfers NORTH to â™ s, then invites by raising to 3â™ .

NORTH has only two trumps, (good ones, admittedly), but she has a maximum 17 point hand.

So she bids the â™  game.}
