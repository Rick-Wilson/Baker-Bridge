{Stayman convention works just fine after a 2NT opening, just at a higher level.

NORTH knows that 6 points will be enough for game opposite SOUTH's 20-21, she just

needs to find out if there is a 4-4 Major suit fit. There is, in â™ s.}

{NORTH has five cards in each Major and SOUTH opens 1NT.

First NORTH bids 2

Then, after SOUTH bids the obligatory 2â™ , NORTH jumps to 4

â™¥

enough strength for game, and also five

â™¥

s to go with the five â™ s.

SOUTH prefers â™ s, so she corrects the contract to 4â™ .}
