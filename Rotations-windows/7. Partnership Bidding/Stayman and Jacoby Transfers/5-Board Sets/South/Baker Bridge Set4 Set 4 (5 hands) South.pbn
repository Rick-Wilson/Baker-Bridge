So NORTH ignores her five

s, having already found

an 8-card Major suit fit. With the fit her hand now revalues to 11 points so she bids 4â™ .}

NORTH again starts with Stayman, and after SOUTH denies a 4-card Major,

NORTH shows her five

s.

But in this Deal SOUTH has only a doubleton

{Even with a 6-card â™  suit SOUTH uses Stayman because he also has a 4-card

â™¥

suit. Given a choice, playing a 4-4 Major fit is usually

preferable to a 6-2 or even a 6-3 fit.

But here NORTH doesn't have four

â™¥

s so SOUTH just bids

the game where he knows the partnership holds eight trumps.}

of bidding just 2
