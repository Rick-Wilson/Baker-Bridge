{NORTH has 11 points and five

s, so she responds

2

â™¦

as a Jacoby Transfer.

When SOUTH bids the required 2

â™¥

, NORTH jumps to 3NT

to show at least 11 points, but only a 5-card

â™¥

suit.

Since SOUTH has only a doubleton

â™¥

she passes 3NT.}

{SOUTH, with a balanced 17 point hand naturally opens 1NT.

NORTH has a really awful hand, but she does hold six â™ s.

So she uses Jacoby Transfer, and when SOUTH bids 2â™  she passes!}

{Stayman convention works just fine after a 2NT opening, just at a higher level.

NORTH knows that 6 points will be enough for game opposite SOUTH's 20-21, she just

needs to find out if there is a 4-4 Major suit fit. There is, in â™ s.}
