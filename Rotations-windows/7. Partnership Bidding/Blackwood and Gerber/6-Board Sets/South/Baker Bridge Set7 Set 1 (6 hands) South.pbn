NORTH only needs to know one thing - how many Aces in the SOUTH hand.

A Blackwood 4NT tells her the answer is one, so she bids 6

{When SOUTH opens 1NT, point-count alone tells NORTH that 6NT can surely be made.

SOUTH is bound to hold at least two Aces. But NORTH doesn't want to miss a Grand slam.

NORTH bids 4â™£, (Gerber), and SOUTH admits to just two Aces.

So NORTH settles for the small slam.}

{SOUTH has a powerhouse and knows she will reach a slam somewhere. When NORTH

Blackwood tells her that NORTH has two Aces.

She can see there are 12 tricks available and decides to take a chance that

NORTH will have a thirteenth trick somewhere among his opening hand points.

She bids 7NT.}
