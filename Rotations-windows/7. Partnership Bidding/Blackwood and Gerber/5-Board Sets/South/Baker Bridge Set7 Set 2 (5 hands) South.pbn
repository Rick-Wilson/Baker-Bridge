{NORTH not only has 20 points, he also has a lot of winners.

So when SOUTH jumps to 2NT, showing 13-15 points, NORTH uses Gerber.

SOUTH shows two Aces so NORTH decides 6NT will be just right.}

SOUTH then bids 3â™ , showing first round control. NORTH tries 4NT (Blackwood) and

SOUTH replies 6â™£. This shows a â™£ void and one Ace, obviously the â™ A.
