{When SOUTH answers Blackwood with one Ace NORTH decides to bid 5NT to ask for Kings.

With two Kings, SOUTH would bid 6

Knowing the 5NT bid guarantees all four Aces, SOUTH figures her â™£ suit will

he stops at 5

{SOUTH might be tempted to blast into Blackwood with his first bid, pushing toward some slam

in

s. He chooses to temporize with a 1

â™¥

response and is rewarded when NORTH jumps to 2NT (18-19 points).

The Notrump bid prevents SOUTH from using Blackwood, but Gerber 4â™£ will work just fine.

When he discovers that NORTH holds three Aces and one King he can count thirteen tricks.}
