{SOUTH has a tough decision after the two Control-showing bids.

He starts with a Gerber 4â™£ and NORTH shows three Aces.

Hmmm, 5â™£ asks for Kings and NORTH shows three.

Hmm, SOUTH can now count all thirteen tricks, so he forgets about the

{NORTH has 13 points and can contribute six tricks so she figures that twelve tricks will be a slam (dunk).

However, just to make sure the opponents don't take the first two tricks she checks with Gerber.

Uh Oh, missing two Aces she signs off at 4NT. She could also happily play 5â™£, but it

would be tricky to get there. Very tricky.}

[Result ""]
{Yes, this has nothing to do with Gerber or Blackwood, but everything to do with smart bidding.

SOUTH has a 16 points and NORTH has 15, 16 or 17. SOUTH wants to be in 6NT if NORTH has 17,

but merely a Notrump game if she has 15 or 16.

The way to find out is to bid 4NT - not Blackwood but merely an invitation to bid 6NT.

In this case, NORTH has but 15 points and declines the invitation. If her

â™¥

Q

were changed to the

â™¥

A she would bid 6NT and collect her twelve easy tricks.}
