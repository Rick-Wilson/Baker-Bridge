at least opening hand, and a â™£ Singleton or Void.

SOUTH manages to figure out that NORTH has a â™  void and bids the slam anyway.}

{SOUTH has a tough decision after the two Control-showing bids.

If he uses Blackwood and NORTH shows two Aces he will be no better off, because he won't know if one

of the Aces is the useless â™ A. Based on knowing that NORTH holds the

â™¦

A,

he bids 6

â™¥

, hoping that he can at least make that and that 7 isn't a laydown!}
