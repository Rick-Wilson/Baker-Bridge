EAST shows two Aces so WEST decides 6NT will be just right.}

SOUTH bids 6â™  since NORTH has not bid strongly enough to think about 7.}

{EAST expects to bid 2NT at his second turn, but WEST gives a positive 2

response and his thinking changes! First he supports

â™¥

s, setting the

trump suit.

WEST then bids 3â™ , showing first round control. EAST tries 4NT (Blackwood) and

WEST replies 6â™£. This shows a â™£ void and one Ace, obviously the â™ A.

EAST bids 6
