{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Surprise - you open 1NT. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid next? (no transfers in this lesson) 

Pass. Partner has long \Hs (probably 6) and short points (fewer than 9). He has decided that 2\H will be a better spot than 1NT. Trust him.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You open 1NT and partner replies 3\H. What do you say next? 

With this bidding method, partner's bid shows at least 10 points and exactly 5 \Hs. He expects you to choose between 3NT and 4\H. Since you have just a doubleton in \Hs you choose 3NT.

NOTE: Jacoby Transfers are very useful for this type of hand.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

Yes this is exactly the same hand you held in Deal 8. You still open 1NT. This time partner responds 3\S. What do you bid? 

Partner shows T+ points and exactly 5 \Ss. This time, with 3-card support, you choose game in \Ss, knowing there is an 8-card fit.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You open 1NT and partner says 3\D. It's your bid. 

Partner has a great hand. A jump to 3 in a Minor suit almost always shows slam interest. But that's partner with interest, not you. You couldn't have a more minimum 1NT opening bid. 

So you just return to 3NT. Partner gives up and passes.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

You open 1NT and partner responds 3\C. What is your next bid? 

Partner's jump to 3\C shows at least 5 \Cs and slam interest. Your hand is good enough to encourage that interest so you bypass 3NT and say 4\C. Partner now bids 4NT. What do you answer? 

That is Blackwood. You admit to one Ace and partner bids 6\C.}

{The bidding has been as shown. It is your bid. What do you say? 

A 1NT overcall is almost the same as a 1NT opening. The range is increased to 15-18, but the main difference is that you must have the opponent's suit adequately stopped. Here you certainly have the stopper so you bid 1NT. Partner responds 2\H. What do you bid next? 

And the responses are the same also. Partner's 2\H bid is a signoff bid, often called a "drop dead" bid. So even though you really like the \Hs you pass. }
