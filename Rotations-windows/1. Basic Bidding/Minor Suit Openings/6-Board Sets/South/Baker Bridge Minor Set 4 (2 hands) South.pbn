{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

You have a very big hand. But there is no need to start jumping before you know whether you have a fit. So just bid 1\S, partner cannot pass this bid.

Partner now surprises you with a jump to 3\S!. What do you bid next? 

Wow! Partner has 16 and you have more than that. Slam appears certain, by why not check for Aces? So you bid 4NT and partner answers 5\C. What do you say next? 

You probably say "Oh Darn!" or perhaps something less printable. But then you just sign of at 5\S.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

That is great support, but always remember when supporting a Minor that partner might have only 3 of them. So you bid 2\D. Partner jumps to 4\D. What do you bid? 

You were cautious with your first bid, but that is over now. Partner didn't open with a 3-card suit, he really has \Ds. He bypassed 3NT in a flash, so he has no interest in playing anywhere but a \D contract. He invites you to bid game if you have something extra above the 6 points you already promised. You have a lot more than that, so you bid 5\D.}
