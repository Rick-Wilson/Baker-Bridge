{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

You must make a weak response, and in theory there are 3 weak responses you could make with this hand. You could bid 2\C, 1\S or 1NT. And while none of them would be actually incorrect the best choice is to show your 4-card Major.

You bid 1\S. Partner jumps to 3\S. What do you say now? 

You started with just 6 points, and after discovering the \S fit you revalue all the way up to 7 points. Partner has shown 16-18 and that's still not enough for game. You pass.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

Your top priority as responder is to show a Major suit if you have one, so you say 1\H. Partner jumps to 3\H. What do you say? 

Partner knows you may have only 6 points and went to the 3-level anyway. He is inviting you to bid game if you have a bit more than the 6 you promised. You revalue up to T so you have quite a bit more. You accept his invitation and bid 4\H.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

You have a very big hand. But there is no need to start jumping before you know whether you have a fit. So just bid 1\S, partner cannot pass this bid.

Partner now surprises you with a jump to 3\S!. What do you bid next? 

Wow! Partner has 16 and you have more than that. Slam appears certain, by why not check for Aces? So you bid 4NT and partner answers 5\C. What do you say next? 

You probably say "Oh Darn!" or perhaps something less printable. But then you just sign of at 5\S.}

{The bidding is shown. Decide what you would say, then  BID. 

That is great support, but always remember when supporting a Minor that partner might have only 3 of them. So you bid 2\D. Partner jumps to 4\D. What do you bid? 

You were cautious with your first bid, but that is over now. Partner didn't open with a 3-card suit, he really has \Ds. He bypassed 3NT in a flash, so he has no interest in playing anywhere but a \D contract. He invites you to bid game if you have something extra above the 6 points you already promised. You have a lot more than that, so you bid 5\D.}
