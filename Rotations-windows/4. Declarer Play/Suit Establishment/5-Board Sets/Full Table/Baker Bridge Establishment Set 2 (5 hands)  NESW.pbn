{South's 3\D bid was a transfer to \Hs. North is to play 3NT. East leads the \S2.

Winners:   \S=2  \H=0  \D=2  \C=1  Total = 5

Obviously you need to establish 4 \H winners and by driving out the \HA you can manage that handily. The problem is that dummy has only one sure entry, (the \SA), and the defenders may be good enough to hold up their \HA twice.

To assure the contract you should win the first trick in your hand with the \SK. Then play \HQ, \HJ overtaking with dummy's \HK so you can continue establishing the suit while you still have that \S entry.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=1  \D=1  \C=0  Total = 2

One of the two red losers must be discarded on dummy's \C suit. So you pull trumps, taking two rounds, with \SK and \SQ. Then play two top \Cs and ruff a \C. When South shows out on the third \C, enter dummy with a trump and ruff another \C. Dummy's final \C is now established, so enter dummy with another trump and discard one of the red losers on the fifth \C.

{South is to play 1NT. West leads the \D6, taken by East with the \DJ. East next plays the \DQ on which West plays the \D2. East plays the \D9 which you finally win.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=1  \C=3  Total = 6

You only need one more winner and you have several possibilities. The \H finesse might work, or the \Cs might split 3-3. But you need to consider the defenders winners also. They have already scored 2 \D tricks and will get 2 more as soon as they gain the lead. (The spot cards told you that West has a 5-card \D suit.) Plus they have the 2 top \Ss which they can take whenever they like. So if your play sets up just one more trick for them you will go down.

No, you must establish \Ss, the suit where they have 2 winners anyway. So you play a \S which West wins. He takes his 2 \Ds but you are now home free. When you gain the lead again you will get your \S winner established and only lose 2 \Ss and 4 \Ds.

If you had played 3 rounds of \Cs you would have gone down with the defenders winning 4 \Ds, 1 \C and 2 \Ss.

Only by establishing \Ss can you make the contract.}

{West is to play 3NT. North leads the \S9, taken by South with the \SA. South next plays the \S4.

Winners:   \S=2  \H=2  \D=1  \C=3  Total = 8

You only need one more winner and if \Ds split 3-3 you can easily establish a trick in that suit. But what if \Ds split 4-2? If the \CJ falls you can get an extra \C trick. In fact, no matter how the \Cs are arranged you can establish your extra trick there.

First make sure that you win the second trick with the \SK, keeping dummy's \SQ for a later entry. Then play \CK, and \CQ overtaking with dummy's \CA. Then play the \CT, losing to the \CJ but establishing the \C9 while you still have the \SQ as an entry.

{North is to play 2NT. East leads the \CK.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=3  \D=2  \C=1  Total = 7

You need to find another winner and the chances are not good. If either black suit splits 3-3 you can establish dummy's fourth card in that suit. But with East's opening lead of the \CK it is unlikely that \Cs will split. So your only slim hope is that the \Ss split 3-3 and dummy's fourth \S will be a winner.

Win the first trick and play a \S to the \SA. Then play another \S. The defense will win and probably take some \C tricks . When they have finished and play a red card, you win it and play a third round of \Ss. If both defenders follow to all three \Ss then dummy's \S8 is now a winner.

Next time they probably won't and you'll go down.}
