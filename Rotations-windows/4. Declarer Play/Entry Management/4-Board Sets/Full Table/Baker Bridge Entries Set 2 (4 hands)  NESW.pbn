{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \S5. 

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=1  \C=5  Total = 9

Wow! The winners add up to 9 already. We have assumed that \Cs will split no worse than 3-1, which is exactly how they do split. Is there any other pitfall you might need to worry about?

Just one minor problem. The \Cs will block if you are not careful\So you win the \SA, then play dummy's \CQ. Next you play dummy's \C8 to your \CK. Then your \CA on which you put dummy's \C7. Aha! Now when you play your \C6 you will be able to keep the lead.

As they are, though, the contract is cold. But only if you are a good bridge player!}

{East is to play 3NT. South leads the \S5. 

Winners:   \S=3  \H=1  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 7

Needing two winners you will naturally consider your 5-card \C suit. After unblocking the \C A K you will need two entries to your hand; one to lead the \CJ and drive out the \CQ, then a second to enjoy your good \Cs.

The \S suit will provide one entry easily, but should you depend on the \HQ for the second entry?

No, for two reasons. Firstly the \HQ only gives you a 50% chance of being an entry. But more importantly, you already have your two sure entries in \Ss. As long as you take the first trick with dummy's \SA both your \SK and  \SJ can be entries.

Win the \SA. Play off dummy's \C A K. Lead the \S9 to your \SJ. Play your \CJ (and another one if necessary) to establish the \C suit. Win whatever red card they play next with dummy's Ace. Play the \SQ to your \SK and cash your established \C(s). Dummy's other red Ace will be your ninth trick.

You'd have to be very careless to miss this one.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \C5. You play low from dummy and East plays the \C6. 

Winners:   \S = 1    \H = 1  \D = 4?    \C = 3 Total = 9

Although you have 4 \D winners, getting to the last couple might not be so easy. You can make 3 \D tricks simply by winning your \DA, then overtaking your \DJ with dummy's \DQ. But you need that fourth \D winner. Can you get it?

Sure you can, by creating an entry in \Cs. It is likely from the opening lead, (and East's play of a small card), that West has led from \C Q T 7 5. If you win the first trick cheaply then you will still make your \C A K for three \C tricks in all.

So don't win cheaply, win the first trick with the \CA. Then unblock your \D A J. Next play \CK. (on which East discards), and a small \C toward dummy's \C J 9. You are sure to have a \C entry to dummy's \Ds, and you will still get three \C tricks, just a different three.

You probably would have played the hand the same way you just did, unblock \Ds, then play \C A K and a low \C toward the \C J 9 trying to get a \C entry to dummy.

It is only because the \C opening lead gives you the chance for a Cheap-Trick that you are tempted to go wrong.}

{West is to play 3NT. North leads the \SQ. South plays the \SK, then the \S2 when you hold up. 

Winners:   \S=1  \H=0  \D=4  \C=1  Total = 6

You are going to have to be pretty lucky to make this contract. You cannot touch the \H suit because a defender would take the \HA and it would start raining \Ss.

So you will have to get 3 extra \C winners, which means the \C finesse absolutely MUST work.

In addition to lucky, you are going to have to be pretty good, too. You will surely have to finesse the \Cs at least twice; that means you need two dummy entries. Can you find them?

Maybe in \Ds. Play the \DK, then \DQ, watching the defender's cards carefully. When both follow twice you know there is only a single \D left out, so you play the \DJ to dummy's \DA. Now take the \C finesse. It works! Next play your \D5 to dummy's \D6 and take another \C finesse. Both defenders follow so your \Cs are good.

Then your chance of success goes way down. You would have to find South with the doubleton \CK.}
