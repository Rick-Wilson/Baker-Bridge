{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \H4, you play low in dummy and East plays the \H8.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=1  \C=2  Total = 5

The winners list looks a little skimpy, but what a nice solid \S suit. It will be a cinch to establish 4 winners in the suit - if only you have an entry to reach them.

You are probably getting good at this by now. The way to make sure of a dummy entry is to pass up the Cheap Trick \H9 and win the first trick with the \HA. Since East did not play third-hand-high he probably doesn't have a high card to play. You are confident that West has led from the \HK so by taking the \HA at once you guarantee you can get back to dummy when you need to do so.

After you win the \HA you start on \Ss, and they hold-up their \SA for one round. But you can get to dummy and the rest of the \Ss by leading toward the \HQ.

Here's a question: How many times at the table have situations like this presented themselves but you didn't realize it? And of course, at the table there is no second page popping up to tell you what you should have done.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \S9, and East plays the \SK.

Winners:   \S=3  \H=2  \D=1  \C=0  Total = 6

I'll bet you got this one. The extra \C tricks you need are winnable only if you can get back to your hand after knocking out the \CA. But the only possible entry card is the \SA. If you use it on the first trick the Defense will hold up their \CA for one trick and your hand will be shot..

So let East keep the first trick, (sacrificing one \S winner), and take the next \S in dummy. Then establish \Cs.

 You sacrifice one \S trick for four \C tricks. A good deal.

There are two basic types; one where you give up a winner to gain an entry, and this type where you get the entry without giving up a thing.

It looks a little different, but the theme is the same. PROTECT YOUR ENTRY.}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \H3, you play dummy's \HJ and East plays the \HQ.

Winners:   \S=0  \H=1  \D=4  \C=1  Total = 6

Unless you want to go down really, really early you had better take your \HK right now. And unless you want to go down almost as early you'd better stay completely away from the \S suit. So that only leaves you the \C suit to get 3 more winners in. East will have to have \CK so you can finesse it. You are also going to have to be smart with entries. Got it?

If East has just \C K x then one finesse, followed by the \CA to drop the \CK and a small \C back to dummy will give you the 4 \C winners you must have. But if East has \C K x x and refuses to cover then you will be able to establish the \Cs but will need an extra dummy entry to enjoy that last winner.

So win the \HK and play the \D K Q. If both defenders follow suit you can afford to overtake your \DJ with dummy's \DA. Now play the \CT and let it ride. If it holds the trick play another \C to your \CJ and then play the \CA, dropping East's \CK.

Enter dummy by playing your \D3 to the \D6 and take your established \C for the ninth trick.

With only one outside entry to dummy your choices are limited.

You might play East for \C K x and lead a small to your \CJ, then play \CA.

Or you might try leading the \CQ hoping that East will see this as a time to "cover an honor with an honor".}

{South is to play 3NT. West leads the \C4, you play dummy's \C5 and East plays the \C7.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=0  \D=2  \C=3  Total = 6

You'd really like to find 3 winners without broaching that \H suit, so you decide to pin your hopes on the \S finesse. But you have a problem. When you win the first trick with the \C9 your only safe entry to dummy is by leading your \CK to the \CA. And this uses up one of your \C winners! Do you see a way to avoid the problem?

Don't win the first trick with the \C9, win with the \CK. Then at trick two enter dummy by playing your \C9 and finessing the \CJ! You are pretty sure West has led from the \CQ so you expect this to work. Then play the \ST, underplaying your \S8. You had better cash the \CA next, then the \SQ, letting it ride if not covered. Finally, one last \S finesse gives you 4 \S winners.

Here it doesn't actually create an extra entry, it just preserves the one entry you have but saves you an actual trick.

Here is an interesting point. Suppose that West's opening lead had been a \H and East had taken the first four \H tricks then played a \D. You would have played the hand the same way! Take the \CK, then finesse the \CJ.}
