{Never mind the bidding. North is to play 7NT. East leads the \CQ.

But there is another possibility; if the same defender holds 4 \Hs and 4 \Ss you will be able to squeeze him in those two suits.

You win the \CK and play \H A K Q to test the \H suit, but East discards a \C on the \HQ. (You tested \Hs first because of dummy's limited entries to the \S suit.) 

Next play your 4 \D winners, discarding a \C from dummy. West follows twice, then starts to feel the pressure. He cannot discard the \HJ because it is guarding your \H2, and since he can see those 4 \Ss in dummy he doesn't want to discard a \S. He discards both his \Cs, trusting East to guard that suit. 

Of course if West had discarded his \HJ you would have cashed your \H2 and then taken three \S winners.

You just executed a Squeeze Play and you didn't even have to try. 

This time it is East who holds the only Guards in both \Ss and \Hs.

You play the \CA and he must give up one of those Guards.}

{East is to play 7\C. South leads the \HK.

You have 11 sure winners in your hand and dummy's \DQ makes 12. Your main hope is for a 3-3 \D split in which case dummy's fourth \D will be a winner.

But there is another possibility in case the \Ds don't split. Dummy's \HQ is a THREAT card which is GUARDED only by South's \HA. If it is South who has the 4 \Ds you will be able to squeeze him.

You ruff the \HK and play 5 more \C winners, being careful not to discard a \D or the \HQ from dummy.  

Play the \S A K and South begins to feel the heat. 

But now you play the SQUEEZE card, the \CA. South absolutely cannot throw away his \HA, so he discards a \D instead.

Since he still has the \HA you know dummy's \HQ is useless so you discard it. Dummy's fourth \D has become a winner. 

North holds the only Guards in both red suits, but he cannot be squeezed.

You must play from dummy BEFORE North plays, so he just matches whatever you do.

If you discard the \HQ North will throw his \HA. If you discard dummy's fourth \D, North will throw his fourth \D.}

{South is to play 6NT. West leads the \CK.

As you see, neither of them splits. However since one defender, East in this case, holds both Guards you should be able to squeeze him. 

Visualize what would happen, though, if you win the first trick and then play your 4 \H winners. East would play his 3 \Cs and 2 \Hs on those 5 tricks and he would not be squeezed. The problem is that you have to RECTIFY THE COUNT. 

East has no problems on the first 3, he just plays his 2 \Hs and 1 \C. 

You will toss dummy's \C8 and East will have to decide whether it is better for him to throw a \S or a \D. He doesn't know that discarding either one is going to hand you the contract, so he will probably discard a \D.  }

The first thing you should do is to duck the \SK. If North foolishly plays another \S your troubles are over. But he doesn't, he plays the \HQ instead which you win with dummy's \HK.  

Next play off your 4 \D winners, discarding a small \H from your hand. 

Play the \CK, \CJ, then over to your \CQ. 

When you now play your \CA, discarding a \S from dummy, North is squeezed.

If he discards the \ST, then his \SQ will fall underneath your \SA, establishing your \SJ.

But if he instead throws the \H9, both of dummy's \Hs will become winners.}

{North is to play 6NT. East leads the \HK.

For a squeeze to operate you will need to lose one trick and the time to do that is right now. Let East hold the \HK and win his \H continuation with your \HA. 

You might as well find out about the \Ss right now. Play the \S A K Q. 

Too bad, East discards a \H on the third round of \Ss.  

Play the \DA, then \D K Q. 

West will follow to all three \Ds.  

Play dummy's \DJ and discard your \HT.

If West discards the \SJ you will cash dummy's \S6, then win the last 3 \C tricks. 

So West will no doubt throw a \C instead. In which case you win the last 4 \C tricks.

Squeezes are so very satisfying.}
