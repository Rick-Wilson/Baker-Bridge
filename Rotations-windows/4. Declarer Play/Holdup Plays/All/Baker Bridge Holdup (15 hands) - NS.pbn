You need 3 more winners, and they must come from the \H suit. The danger is that when you knock out the \HA, East may take too many \Ds. To exhaust West of \Ds you hold-up your \DA until the third round.

Next you start on \Hs by playing \HK, then overtaking the \HT. Assume that West wins the second \H.

You were fortunate it was West who took the \HA, and that he has no \D to return. If he plays a \H or a \S you will win in dummy. If he plays a \C you will jump up with the \CA and take your winners, 9 in all.

But if you had not held-up your \DA even good luck wouldn't have helped you.}

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=0  \C=2  Total = 5

Even if \Hs split 3-3 you could only get 2 extra winners there, so it should be clear that you must establish the \Ds. You will have to drive out the \DA and hope they don't win too many \Ss at that time. You can help your chances by a hold-up of the \SA until the third round.

Having just taken the third \S trick you now work on \Ds by first playing the \DK, then continuing the suit. East wins the third one with his \DA. And now the good news - he has no \S left to reach his partner's good tricks. So East plays the \HQ.

At this point in the play you have three tricks in the bank; \SA, \DK, \DQ. You take your \HK, cash the two good \Ds, then lead to dummy for the \CA K and \HA. Voila!  

But what if East actually held 4 \Ss? No problem, in that case the \Ss would have split 4-4 so the defenders could only win 3 \S tricks and the \DA.

The hold-up lets you make the contract whenever East holds the \DA. And if West happened to hold the \DA??? You go down.}

Winners:   \S=1  \H=2  \D=1  \C=3  Total = 7

You can win 3 more \D tricks if the finesse works, but even if it doesn't work you can still get the 2 that you need. Of course if West does win the \DK it would sure be great if he had no \S to lead. So you duck the second \S and take your \SK when they play a third round.

After winning the \SK you are conveniently in your hand, so you play the \DQ and let it ride when East plays a low card. Alas, West takes the trick with his \DK.

It's too bad the finesse didn't work, but it's not too too bad! Because West is out of \Ss and must lead one of the other suits. You don't care which he leads because you can now win 8 more tricks and make your contract.

And as long as you had held up on the \SK until the third round you could ensure that West was out of \Ss if he had started with only 3.}

{North is to play 3NT. East leads the \H4. West plays the \HT.

Winners:   \S=1  \H=1  \D=3  \C=1  Total = 6

You may not agree with North's 3NT bid but how else are you going to get to the only game that has a chance of making?

You need 3 extra winners and they will come from the \C suit even if East holds the \CK and wins your finesse. You may think about holding up on the \HA for one round just to make sure East has none if he wins the \CK.

That would be a mistake. It is almost certain that West has a 7-card \H suit for his preemptive opening. This is confirmed by East's lead of the \H4, with a doubleton he would have led a higher card. So there is no need to hold up. But . . . it couldn't hurt, could it?

Yes, it could hurt real bad\Suppose West has nothing in his hand but the \H K Q J T 8 7 6 that you already know about. When you let his \HT win the first trick he will realize that his hand is dead. And he may be smart enough, (or lucky enough), to switch to a \S. 

 to see why you should definitely win the first trick, then enter dummy with the \DA and take the \C finesse. 

But one of the important considerations you have to think about is the possibility that the Defense will switch to another suit - where you might be in even more trouble.

You'd feel bad on this hand if you let West hold the \HT only to see him next lay down the \SJ.}

{North's 2\C cue-bid shows a limit-raise or better in \Ss. South is to play 4\S. West leads the \C2. East plays the \CK.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=1  \C=1  Total = 4

You have one loser too many. If West holds either the \HA or the \DK this will be an easy contract, but East opened the bidding so he probably has most of the high cards. It does look like West holds the \CQ based on his low lead and East's play to trick one.

Having gone through that thought process what is your Plan?

You will need to discard a loser on dummy's fourth \D, but you must do so without ever letting West gain the lead since West is the defender who can lead through dummy's \HK. And the only card that West can get the lead with is the \CQ.

Hold-ups are usually used in notrump hands, but here you use one to prevent the Danger Hand from gaining the lead. Let East have the \CK. He cannot play a red card without helping you so he will surely play another \C. 

Pull trumps in two rounds. Then play the \DT and let it ride.

East will win this but he is helpless. Whatever he plays you will be able to discard a \H loser on dummy's \D.

If you had taken the first \C trick East would have won your later \D finesse, put his partner on lead with the \CQ and then swallowed up your \HK.

Of course if West had been clever enough to lead a \H originally this Deal wouldn't be here.}

Winners:   \S=0  \H=2  \D=0  \C=2  Total = 4

You will need to establish both \S and \D winners. If West holds both these Aces along with 6 \Hs to the Q J then you are going down. But of course West can't have that good a hand, he opened with a Weak-2. So East has one of the Aces.

If you knew which Ace West held you could make sure you attacked that suit first but unfortunately you have no way of knowing that. So instead you resort to a hold-up. Let West have the first \H and win the next \H in dummy.

Start on \Ds next, maybe because they are longer. Assume that East holds the \DA and takes it on the third round of the suit.

East glares at you, (because he has no \H to lead), and plays the \CQ which you take with your \CA. Next you score your \D winners and play a \S, taken by West with the \SA.

West glares at you, (because you still have the \HA), and plays another \H to your Ace. You take your 3 tricks and let East have the last \C.

If you did not hold up on the first trick, but established \Ss first you would have made the contract even though you played incorrectly.

If you held up on the first trick you made the contract no matter which Ace East held.}

You just need one more winner and it could come from the \D suit if it happens to split 3-3. But you have another possibility. Suppose you let West hold the first trick and he decides to play another \H? You would have two \H winners.

This isn't a true hold-up play although it does look like one. This play has the rather fancy name of Bath Coup, (named from Bath, England). Presumably West has led from \H K Q T 9 5 and East has played his singleton \H6. If West realizes that East has played his lowest card he will take that as a discouraging signal and will play a different suit. So you throw out your \H7 rather than the \H3. Now West may think that East is encouraging him to continue, just what you want.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Because if he doesn't you're going to have to end-play him.

Do you see how that might happen?}

To prevent that from happening all you have to do is hold up on the first \D. You have to lose one trick in the suit no matter what, so lose it right now to East, the Safe Hand. East continues with another \D which you win.

 . 

You go over to dummy with a \H and play the \SQ, letting it ride. East wins with his \SK, but cannot play \Cs from his side of the table without handing you a trick. Whatever else he plays you win, pull trumps, and discard a \C loser on dummy's fourth \H.

At suit contracts the most common reason for a hold-up is to keep the Danger Hand from getting the lead.}

Unless there is a miracle in the \Ds, (or a defensive error), you can't get a trick in that suit. But you have a chance for a second \H trick.

It's the Bath Coup again, just dressed up a little differently. 

Let West hold the first trick, playing the \H7 from your hand to conceal the \H4 in the hope that West will continue the suit. If he does you have your ninth trick - if he doesn't, good luck.

It's pretty clear that your extra tricks are going to have to come from the \C suit. The danger here is that East may have a 5-card \S suit that he can establish and the \CA as an entry. So what is the best approach, hold up or not hold up?

To answer that question you must think about East's lead. Since he did not lead the \SK you know he doesn't have a suit headed by K Q J. So you can visualize West sitting there with a doubleton honor in \Ss. It might be \S K x, \S Q x or \S J x, but it is surely one of those three.

Think what West will do if you duck in dummy. He will play his honor, win the trick, and clear the suit by leading his small x. If East can get in with the \CA he will run the \Ss.

But what will West do if you play dummy's \SA? If he plays his small one the \S suit will block. If he unblocks his honor card then your \S T 9 5 3 will provide a second stopper in the suit. So you go up with dummy's \SA and guarantee the contract.

Of course from now on you will recognize it.}
