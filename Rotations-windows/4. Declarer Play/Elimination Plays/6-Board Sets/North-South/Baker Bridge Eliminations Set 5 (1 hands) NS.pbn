{North plays 6\C. East leads the \S8.

You have one \S loser and one \D loser. A successful finesse will take care of either one of them. Chance of the \S finesse working? Zero. Chance of the \D finesse working? Maybe 50%. Chance of an elimination play? Priceless.

Win the \SA and pull trumps with the \CA and \CQ. They split 2-1.

Play the \DA, just in case there is a singleton \DQ somewhere. There isn't. Then eliminate \Hs by playing \HA and ruff a \H.

Now play a low \S from both hands. East doesn't follow suit as West wins with a small card.

West is end-played. He has no \Cs. If he plays a \D it will be into dummy's \D K J. If he plays a \H you will discard a \D from your hand and ruff in dummy. If he plays the \SK you will ruff, and dummy's \SQ will be promoted. If he plays a small \S you will let it ride to dummy's \SQ.

I hope you enjoyed them.}
