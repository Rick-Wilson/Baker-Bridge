{South is to play 4\S. West leads the \DJ, covered by the \DQ and \DA. East returns a \D to the \DK.  

You still have two losers in the \H suit, so the question is which way you plan to finesse the \Cs. And of course the answer is that you don't plan to finesse them at all!

Pull trumps with the \SA, then \SK. Next ruff dummy's last \D.

Now exit with a \H. The defenders win this and take another \H trick, leaving this position.

They must now break the \C suit for you or give you a ruff-sluff. Of course you would ruff in dummy and discard a \C from the 3-card holding in your hand.

If West is the one who has to play a \C you need to insert the \CT or \CJ from dummy.

In either case you will no longer have a \C loser.}

{North decides a limit raise is better than just jumping to game. South has heard enough and bids the slam. 

South is to play 6\S. West leads the \DQ.

So you win the \DK and play a \S to your \SK. When West discards a \D your second thought is probably that you MUST guess the \CQ just to make twelve tricks.

Hopefully your third thought is that if you use an elimination play you won't have to guess.

Play your \SA, leaving East with the master \SQ. Then eliminate \Ds by playing \DA and ruffing a \D in dummy.

Now eliminate \Hs by playing \HA, \HK, and ruffing a \H.

You are ready for the throw-in. Play a \S to East's \SQ.

East has just taken the defender's first trick. First and only. Because if he now plays a red card you will ruff in one hand and discard a losing \C from the other. And if he plays a \C you will no longer have a \C loser.

Here it took two ruffs, one in each hand.}

[Result ""]
{North first transfers you to \Hs, then gives you a choice of which game to play.  Knowing you have an 9-card trump fit, you choose 4\H. 

South is to play 4\H. The defenders start with \SK, \SQ, \SA.

Ruff the \SA with dummy's \HT and pull trumps (three rounds).

Eliminate \Ds by playing \DK, \DA, \DJ. If you are REALLY lucky the \DQ will fall doubleton, but more than likely a defender will win the third \D. He won't be happy about it, though.

Whichever defender wins the \DQ is end-played. If he plays a \D or a \S you will ruff in one hand and discard a \C loser from the other. But if he leads a \C instead you no longer have a \C loser.

However, it also guarantees that you will not make an overtrick.

If you try the two finesses instead you MIGHT make an overtrick, but you also might go down 1.

Decide for yourself!}

[Result ""]
{You naturally respond 2\D to North's strong 2\C opener. Before you know it you are playing a slam - with your mighty 2-point hand\South plays 6\D. West leads the \SQ.

Win the \SA, play the \D4 to the \DT, and ruff a \S with the \DQ. Both opponents followed to the trump. 

Play the \D7 to the \DJ and ruff the last \S with the \DK.

Having eliminated the \Ds and \Ss, now remove the \Hs. Play \HA, \HK, and ruff a \H. 

At last it is time to play \Cs. Lead a \C from your hand and play dummy's \C9 if West plays low. East will win the trick but will be end-played, forced to either play a \C back to dummy's \C A Q, or give you a ruff-sluff. 

If West puts on either the \CT or \CJ you play dummy's \CQ. If East can win with the \CK he will once again be end-played, forced to either play a \C back to dummy's \CA 9, or give you a ruff-sluff.

As you see, A Q 9 actually works just as well.}
