Losers:   \S = 2    \H = 1 or 2  \D = 0    \C = 0 Total = 3 or 4

In fact if trumps split 5-0 you could have 3 losers in the suit and a disaster. So we won't worry about that possibility. Since the most likely scenario is a 3-2 split you should plan on taking the \H A K, then driving out their master trump so you can run dummy's \Cs without somebody ruffing in.

Bad news. East discards a \D on the second \H lead. Time for a change in plans? 

Actually, no. West has 2 master trumps at this point but you still have \H 9 7 5 3. So use one of your little ones to drive out West's \HJ. He will probably force you to ruff a \D, leaving you with \H 9 7. Use one of them to force out West's \HQ. You still have a trump left to stop their \Ds, and as soon as you get the lead you can now run dummy's \C suit safely.

He would have ruffed the third \C, before you could discard a \S loser from your hand. You would lose two trumps and two \Ss.}

{East is to play 4\S. South leads the \CJ.

Losers:   \S=2  \H=0  \D=1  \C=1  Total = 4

Unless the defense slips you are going to lose the Ace and King of trumps. And the \DA is a Fast loser that they can take whenever they want to, so that means you must try to dispose of your \C loser. The only realistic hope is that South holds the \DA and you can lead through it twice. So after you win your \CA do you play a trump? 

As much as you'd like to get the trumps out you must work on the \Ds first. Because if you play even one trump the defense will win it and force out your remaining \C stopper before you have established a \D winner for the discard.

The correct procedure is to win the \CA, and immediately play a \D to dummy's \DQ, which holds the trick. Return to your hand with a \H, and play another \D toward dummy. Suppose South takes his \DA on this trick (otherwise you have no \D loser). He can now play a \C but you win with dummy's \CK and discard your small \C on dummy's \DK.

Only then do you lead trumps.

for the full deal. 

When you need to do something else first - in this case, to establish a \Ds winner early.}

{South is to play 4\H. West leads the \SK, taken by dummy's \SA.

Losers:   \S=0  \H=0  \D=1  \C=3  Total = 4

One possibility is to pull trumps and play for a 3-3 \D split. This will occur about 36% of the time. While you may not know all the bridge probabilities, it is useful to remember that an EVEN number of cards (6 in this case) will probably NOT split EVENLY (3-3 in this case). So, let's try to improve on 36%.

You could play to pull just two rounds of trumps, then ruff your fourth \D, hoping that the defender with the third trump also has the fourth \D. These odds are tougher to figure, but it doesn't look good, does it?

If you don't see a better Plan than these two, just put yourself in Dummy's seat and pretend you are playing 4\H from that side of the table. 

Aha! From dummy's viewpoint you have no \D losers! You still have the 3 \C losers, but now you also have 3 \S losers. How does this help you?

You can now ruff all 3 of those \S losers in the South hand. Like this:Win the \SA and ruff a \S with the \HA. Play a small \H to dummy's \H9. Ruff another \S with the \HK. Play a small \H to dummy's \HT. Ruff dummy's last \S with your last trump, the \HJ. Enter dummy with a \D and pull the last trump with the \HQ.

You win 3 \Ds, 3 \Hs in dummy, the \SA and 3 \S ruffs in your hand. Total: T tricks.

For a Dummy Reversal to work you usually have to have a decent trump split.}

{West is to play 4\H. North leads the \DK.

Losers:   \S=2  \H=1  \D=0  \C=1  Total = 4

You could go to dummy with the \SA and try a finesse for the \CK. If it works, no more \C loser. But if it fails the bad guys will cash a couple of \Ss and even you can't dodge the Ace of trumps.

Or, you could try to get to dummy with a trump to the \HJ so you could make the \C finesse while dummy still keeps the \SA. Of course the defenders would probably take the first \H and then knock out your \SA. When the \C finesse failed, same bad result. What else might you try? 

Forget the \C finesse. Forget pulling trumps. Win the first trick and play any \C from your hand. Let's say you play the \CJ. A defender wins the \CK and attacks \Ss. Too late, you are in the driver's seat. Win the \SA, play a \C to your \CQ, and then play the \CA, discarding a \S from dummy. You lose the Ace of trumps, one \C, and just one \S.

Trying to sneak into dummy with a trump might have worked.

Playing a \C from your hand at the second trick WILL work.}
